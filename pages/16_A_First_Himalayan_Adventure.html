</p>

<p>
The Nanda Devi Sanctuary is situated in the Garwhal Himalaya
about two hundred miles north east of Delhi, twenty miles from
the border with Tibet and fifty miles from the western end of
Nepal. Within the Sanctuary and linked to its eastern rim is
Nanda Devi  the &ldquo;Goddess Nanda&rdquo; and India&rsquo;s highest summit . In
the days of the British Empire it was also the highest mountain
in the Empire and the area has long been of particular interest
to British mountaineers.
</p>

<p>
The Sanctuary consists of a ring of mountains seventy miles
in circumference, minimum height 17,000 ft, average height about
20,000 ft and with no fewer than nineteen peaks over 21,000 ft.
It is some two hundred and forty square miles in area and drained
by the Rishi Ganga which breaks through the rim on the west in a
stupendous gorge. For about fifty years surveyors, explorers and
climbers  including W.W. Graham, Longstaff, Bruce, Rutledge,
Wilson and Somervell  were unable to penetrate the &ldquo;Inner
Sanctuary&rdquo; either over the rim, or at the point where the Rishi
Ganga breaks through the ridges coming down from Maiktoli and
Changabang. It was in 1934 that Eric Shipton and Bill Tilman with
three Sherpa porters managed to force a route through the gorge
at this point into the &ldquo;Inner Sanctuary&rdquo; and in 1936, Tilman and
N.E. Odell reached the summit of Nanda Devi itself.
</p>

<p>
There was a lot of climbing activity in the Garwhal area in
the 1920&rsquo;s and 1930&rsquo;s  Bill Murray&rsquo;s Scottish Himalayan
Expedition was there in 1950, but the whole area was virtually
closed to foreigners from the time of Chinese invasion of India
in 1962 until 1976, except for joint expeditions including Indian
members. One of these was Chris Bonington&rsquo;s party which made the
first ascent of the vast white granite dome of Changabang
 22,250 ft , approaching from the Ramani Glacier over Shipton&rsquo;s
Col to the Changabang Glacier and then via the narrow east ridge
to the summit.
</p>

<p>
After that and before our visit, there had been only a
limited number of other climbing expeditions into the &ldquo;Inner
Sanctuary&rdquo; and for the last few years access had been restricted
for conservation reasons   the local nomadic shepherds had found
another high level route into the &ldquo;Inner Sanctuary&rdquo;  and were
jeopardising the burral  wild blue Himalayan sheep  and other
animals by overgrazing.
</p>

<p>
For me it all began when the telephone rang one evening in
October 1976. A friend at the other end asked:
&ldquo;Would you like to join us on a trip to the Himalaya?&rdquo;
The immediate answer was, of course:
&ldquo;YES!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The concept was for a small lightweight party to trek into
the Nanda Devi Sanctuary and possibly &ldquo;have a look at&rdquo; one or
more of the peaks.
</p>

<p>
Originally it was to be a mixed bunch of four &ldquo;middle aged&rdquo;
friends from other climbing and skiing trips: Donald an
architect, Hamish a writer and Stephen a physicist in addition to
myself. We thought it was a good idea to have a doctor in the
party so Frank was invited to join us. Later, two younger
members, Peter a computer expert and Ian an engineer, joined in
to make a total of seven. We had intended to go in the pre monsoon period,
but during our preparations we learned that there
was usually a short period of more settled weather post monsoon
and before the onset of winter. We changed our plans so that we
could do the nine day trek into the Sanctuary as the monsoon
faded and have good weather whilst we were up there.
</p>

<p>
So as not to be too much of a burden on our hosts whilst
completing formalities and purchasing provisions and fuel, we
split the party and travelled out to Delhi on different dates.
The first group took the &ldquo;Musoorie Express&rdquo; up to Hardwar and
then went on by local train to Rishi Kesh and by bus up to
Joshimath. Ian stayed on in Delhi to meet Stephen, Frank and
myself on our arrival. The four of us completed our shopping,
made a day trip to Agra to see the famous Taj Mahal erected in
1632 53 and then followed up to Joshimath. The others had rented
a motel room  there as  a base where they could leave gear whilst
they went off on a week&rsquo;s acclimatization trek up the Bhyunder
Valley   &ldquo;The Valley of the Flowers&rdquo;   visited by Frank Smythe in
</p>
<ol class="org-ol">
<li>We followed on a four day trek, camping in the meadows at
</li>
</ol>
<p>
10,000 ft and climbing to the Sikh temple at Hemkund at
14,000 ft. Unfortunately we were rather late to see the flowers
at their best  like us, they were being battered by the monsoon
rains.
</p>

<p>
The whole party assembled back at the motel room where we
spent the next three days purchasing rice, flour, ghee and
vegetables, making everything up into approximately fifty six pound porter loads.
We completed arrangements for a lorry from
Joshimath to Lata which we shared with a five member Australian
expedition heading for Changabang. There was a shortage of
porters and we had to use a herd of goats  each carrying about
twenty two pounds  in panniers, in addition to our thirty two
porters.
</p>

<p>
The trek proper started on September 10th and half an hour
after leaving the roadside, we were in the headman&rsquo;s house in the
village of Lata drinking rakshi. We staggered out two hours later
to climb a steep track up the wooded hillside to our first
&ldquo;Tilman Stage&rdquo; campsite, where we used the actual platforms
levelled by Shipton and Tilman when they found this route into
the Sanctuary forty three years previously.
</p>

<p>
The route into the Sanctuary crosses the Dharansi Pass at
15,400 ft, descends to a lovely wooded alp at Dibrugheta and then
traverses high above the Rishi Gorge. It was from here that we
caught our first glimpse of &ldquo;The Mountain Goddess&rdquo; as the clouds
parted for a few minutes.
</p>

<p>
Deodi campsite was reached after crossing the Rishi Ganga on
a rickety bridge and there the porters made a sacrificial
offering of a goat, cooked over a wood fire and then eaten for
supper that night.
</p>

<p>
Our next campsite was at Ramani at the foot of the gorge
forming the entrance to the &ldquo;Inner Sanctuary&rdquo;. The goats had to
return from here as the next obstacle was a 1,500 feet high
almost vertical damp cliff, covered with loose vegetation, which
we found quite difficult and intimidating  shortly after that we
came to the famous &ldquo;Tilman Slabs&rdquo; with a drop of about 1400 feet
into the Rishi Gorge below. Fortunately there was a fixed rope
across them, left by a large Japanese party which had gone up ten
days previously.
</p>

<p>
From Tilchaunani campsite we had magnificent views of Nanda
Devi  25,695 ft  and Nanda Devi East  24,391 ft , the peaks on
the Sanctuary rim, the confluence of the rivers dividing the
South and North Inner Sanctuaries and which we had to cross  also
the area near the snout of the Changabang Glacier where we hoped
to make our base camp.
</p>

<p>
We rigged a pulley system with ropes from boulders  to get
porters, loads and ourselves over the first river torrent at the
bottom of a deep ravine. The porters refused to cross the second
river as it was necessary to wade through almost waist deep
glacier melt water with only a hand line for support, so we paid
them off and ferried the loads over ourselves. It was a very cold
and tired team that camped alongside the river that night.
The following day we walked up the valley on soft springy
turf, with ever changing and exciting views of the surrounding
glaciers and peaks. We set up base camp in an absolutely idyllic
position at 14,000 ft, with abundant supplies of juniper wood and
a freshwater spring, alongside the Uttar Rishi glacier at the
foot of the North Ridge of Nanda Devi which rose 11,000 feet
above us.
</p>

<p>
For the next four weeks we went out singly or in groups of
two or three for periods of up to  four or five days, exploring
the Inner Sanctuary, crossing the glaciers and camping in some
utterly enchanting situations, returning to base camp for a rest
and to pick up more provisions for our next trip.
</p>

<p>
All too soon, just as Stephen and I were packing our sacks
for another four day trek, the first porters returned to carry
out for us. They were three days earlier than we had arranged
because they expected a change in the weather. The others agreed
that Stephen and I should complete our plans, leaving them to
sort things out with the porters.
</p>

<p>
When we got back to base camp there was only one tent and
two porters there, all the others having left for Joshimath three
days earlier! The four of us followed next morning. There was a
light covering of snow which enhanced the autumn colours, but
which on the steep shaded sides of the ravines and the gorge made
the route finding and the going very much more difficult. Late in
the afternoon, our porters refused to go any further and we were
forced to build a stone platform for one two man tent into which
all four of had to squeeze.
</p>

<p>
Next morning we realised just how right the porters had
been, as on the next section snow was still lying on extremely
steep grass and rock slopes where a slip would have resulted in a
fall of at least 1,500 feet. We descended with the utmost
caution, the porters frequently calling for a rope which in fact
provided only  psychological belay as it was impossible to drive
an axe into the frozen ground and there were seldom suitable
rocks for secure belays.
</p>

<p>
At Ramani campsite an upset billy can of water scalded
Stephen&rsquo;s foot but fortunately, as a result of my first aid
treatment, he was able to continue the walk out next morning.
We camped again at Dibrugheta and reached Lata the following
day, tired and hungry but elated at having completed one of the
most interesting and challenging treks one is likely to tackle in
a lifetime&rsquo;s walking.    The journey by Indian public transport back to Delhi was
only slightly less interesting and challenging. There we were
briefly reunited with the rest of the party before flying home.
Although the Sanctuary is at the present time a &ldquo;forbidden area&rdquo;
there are still lots of beautiful, interesting and remote places
to visit in the Garwhal Himalaya.
