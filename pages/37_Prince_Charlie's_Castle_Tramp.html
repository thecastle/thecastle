<em>by Dave Kime</em>
</p>

<p>
The idea was dreamed up in Culra Bothy on a dark November
night. The parents-in-law were in New Zealand and had taken to
backpacking and bothying. Soon they were to retire, so what
better than a short backpacking trip for them around the Scottish
Highlands? What evolved was a 200 mile trek through the glens,
linked with some stretches of imagination to the stravaigings of
Bonnie Prince Charlie. There was perhaps even more of a link with
the wanderings of the CMC and these came to mind from time to
time as we acted as support party for the walk.
</p>

<p>
The Tramp started at the Prince&rsquo;s Cairn on Loch nan Uamh
whence it is but a short sail to the Isles. The Cuillin of Rhum,
visible from the hills between here and Lochailort Hotel, brought
to mind the climbs and scrambles on that ridge, of nights in
Dibidil Bothy, of bivvies on Allival watching the sunset and the
flying bunnies returning to their nests after a day&rsquo;s fishing
and of a descent from Orval in thick cloud down a steep gully
with Andy and myself leading only ten feet apart and our
compasses pointing in opposite directions. The Tramp continued
now across wild country to Oban Bothy on Morar where the
isolation became apparent when a maternal shoulder was dislocated
crossing a swollen burn and we evacuated by Glen Pean.
</p>

<p>
The Bothy here was now deserted, unlike our visit late one
December when our sleep had then been disturbed at 3 am. Morning
revealed two bodies upstairs and two crates of whisky downstairs
and by evening, crowds were appearing through the blizzard from
all directions and the wall was stacked high with whisky, beer,
turkeys and more. St. Andrews University MC were celebrating New
Year here in true Scottish style, including a midnight swim in
the burn by the President  who&rsquo;ll suggest at the next AGM that we
adopt this tradition?  Undeterred, we started to cook the curry
in a quiet corner, until a snowman appeared and asked if there
was anyone from Sheffield with a ginger beard. Our friends had
gone to A&rsquo;Chuill Bothy, he informed us. A moonlit walk with a
half-cooked curry took us in a few miles to this darkened Bothy
where at 8 pm we awoke Andy and Rosy and two strangers, lit some
candles and continued cooking the meal. Mice  rats?  nibbled at
the left overs while we slept.
</p>

<p>
We passed above A&rsquo;Chuill again the following year as we
continued the next stage of the Tramp, across to Kinbreak Bothy
and then to a camp in Glen Loyne where the river rose three feet
in the night. Decadence and the Cluanie Inn. Cluanie, land of the
Five Sisters, the Seven Brothers, the Three Uncles, the Two
Grannies and the South Cluanie Ridge, where in years gone by Rosy
had drunk a stream dry and Drew had tested a home made tent
almost to destruction.
</p>

<p>
The route now took us on through Glen Affric, where we had
once spent an Easter of hot sun and melting snow and saw no-one
for a week, and where we ticked off  Bens Chrysanthemum and
Sod-All  where the Youth Hostel was left open and unlocked and
was inaccessible by car. On to Fort Augustus and Loch Ness with
not a tick in sight and then the General&rsquo;s Road over the
Corrieyairack Pass where mother in law broke a foot in steep snow
and hopped three miles to the camp at Melgarve. Blue skies now
over Creag Meagaidh, where a decade ago we had walked in a circle
in a blizzard while the rest of the Club played hide-and-seek on
Carn Mor Dearg, tempted by Mike&rsquo;s slides of perfect weather on
the previous year&rsquo;s Glen Roy meet.
</p>

<p>
The Tramp continued again the next year, but after two
mishaps I left Jenny to act as support on her own. For
mother-in-law to be injured once might be a misfortune, twice
might be carelessness, but three times&#x2026;!  And so past  Garva
Bridge from which we had skied up the Monadhliaths, but now on to
Pattack and Culra Bothies. No time to call at Ben Alder Cottage
where the Club had kept the evil spirits at bay by liberal use of
the more benign malted type. Loch Ossian and its rail access
hostel, Loch Treig and on to Meanach Bothy.  Fourteen years
previously, we had used it before the Mountain Bothies
Association had fitted windows and doors. Straw beds and clear
skies with a million stars through the open window at night,
sun, snow  and ice on the Grey Coires by day.
</p>

<p>
Beyond were the Aonachs and memories of setting off one
clear October day from Glen Roy, stoked by egg and  bacon served
in bed in a frozen tent at 6 am, Al and  Kate ahead driving
erratically as they spotted birds at dawn  and from the summit,
distant views of all the Highlands. Cool enough for us but still
too hot for Jimmy to put a shirt on. Back in Sheffield two days
later, Mike&rsquo;s tent was still frozen, but his throat was still hot
from the vindaloo curry and gluwein which I had served at the end
of the previous day. The Tramp took us on past Binneins Mor and
Beag and the lochan between where the Club  once swam one wet day
in July. So on to Mamore Lodge, a friendly place for mountain
folk - what a change from  many years ago when an innocent new
member took up an offer to join Mike Munrotic for a walk in the
Mamores. The alarm went at 6 am when Mike&rsquo;s ample rear end hit
the floor at Lagangarbh  after a direct descent from the top
bunk. At 7.30 we drove up the private road past the Lodge and
were soon afterwards on the first Top, Am Bodach. By eleven the
Gearanachs &amp; Garbhanachs were done, three more ticks, and there
was just &ldquo;that little conical job over there&rdquo; to do to complete
Section Four. No messing about over Na Gruagaichean and Binnein
Mor for Mike: the direct route by a three mile traverse across
the rough heathery coire to Binnein Beag, but rewarded by the
sight of red deer in their thousands . Last tick of the Section
and back to the car. Two flat tyres but Good Scout Mike was
prepared with a hand pump and we were off towards the Lodge.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Daddy, Daddy, they&rsquo;re coming!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There followed a short legal discussion on the law of
trespass in Scotland from my solicitor to the local keeper whose
response sounded remarkably like &ldquo;Bugger Off&rdquo;. The welcome is now
of a better type, but with all rooms taken we camped by the pond
and ate and drank in the bar. The tourist route of the West
Highland Way passes here and we followed it now before leaving
the ant-trail to cross to Corran ferry.
</p>

<p>
Across in Ardgour, Glen Scaddle led to Resourie Bothy where
one Christmas the two of us collected so much wood in just an
hour that we spent the whole evening trying in vain to burn it
all. Beyond is Ben Resipol where one New Year a Castle group
inched on their stomachs towards the summit, precariously
anchored by their axes in a blizzard with ferocious winds. We
failed and evacuated by the nearest gully which led to the bogs
by Loch Shiel. Next day the tabloids screamed &ldquo;Gales Lash
Britain&rdquo; and a neighbour later said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it was a bit windy, our dustbin lid blew off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Warned of the bogs, the two pensioners completed the Tramp
by first rowing six miles down Loch Shiel to the new Hothersall
Bothy at Langal for the night  and then another two to Acharacle
before the path to their final bothy at Druimnich, where a number
of the Club have been conned into transporting large chunks of
oak and birch, seemingly for miles across hills and bogs, to keep
the winter fires burning.
</p>

<p>
When there&rsquo;s nothing left to tick and the last table of the
Scottish hundred footers has been put away, you can always invent
a walk though the glens to see you into your Seventies. Castle
memories await you there.
