Why climb mountains? This is a question which has been asked
so many times over and is one to which it is difficult to give a
satisfactory answer. The question is usually posed in such a way
that a dramatic answer is expected  but this need not necessarily
be the case: mountaineers climb mountains for different reasons
and these reasons can change each time an ascent is made. One
reason may be the basic primeval urge to pit one&rsquo;s resources
against what nature has to offer, but it might equally well be an
escape from one&rsquo;s normal environment in order to release pent up
pressures.
</p>

<p>
Whatever the reason, mountains are Nature&rsquo;s answer to these
pressures and to involve oneself completely in their presence is
an experience from which one returns refreshed and better able
spiritually, physically and mentally to face up to life as we
experience it.
</p>

<p>
 My own involvement goes back to childhood days when a tree
with plenty of branches presented a challenge and  small outcrops
of rock provided an outlet for youthful zeal. The war years
afforded the opportunity to climb abroad  in The Lebanon,
Australia and New Guinea  but since then all my climbing has been
in Scotland, The Lake District, North Wales and The Peak
District.
</p>

<p>
The late fifties marked for me a late self proving era when
in the company of good friends I spent many weekends on the crags
of Glencoe and Ben Nevis, rock climbing in summer and snow and
ice climbing in winter. My companions of those happy days went on
to to greater things and tragically many are now gone, having
died on the very hills they loved so much.
</p>

<p>
I have remained actively involved in climbing and skiing
in my time I have founded two mountaineering clubs, one in
Sheffield and the other in Livingston near Edinburgh   but no
longer do I have the urge to tackle the impossible. However, one
must guard against the ever present urge to modify difficulty.
Organized society habitually seeks the smoothest way. With
mechanization and labour saving devices, life has become so
smooth that some of us seek a necessary corrective in grappling
with rough undisciplined crags. For me, climbing has always
seemed to embody some immutable principle: something stable in a
changing world.
</p>

<p>
Many people look upon mountaineering as a dangerous pastime
and believe that its devotees take their lives in their hands
whenever they go climbing. But the average mountaineer probably
does not incur more danger to life than a man who heartily goes
in for any one of half a dozen favourite pastimes. Admittedly,
there is an element of danger in serious climbing, but it is, or
should be, a calculated risk. In climbing snow or rocks,
familiarity does not breed contempt, but it does enable one to
see things in their true proportions, to appreciate real dangers
and to ignore imaginary ones, and particularly to gauge just what
one can achieve personally. Climbing is a test of nerve, skill,
endurance and judgement  the climber should know his limitations
and how far he can risk a move in safety. In proportion to the
large numbers of climbers active on the hills, the loss of life
by accident is in fact infinitesimal.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A man is immortal &lsquo;til his work is done&rdquo; and if he is ready
for the call when it comes, he may just as well perish on a
mountainside as be bowled over by a car, or succumb to fatty
degeneration of the heart.
</p>

<p>
In Ruskin&rsquo;s beautiful words:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mountains are the great cathedrals of the earth, with their
gates of rock, pavements of cloud, choirs of stream and stone,
altars of snow and vaults of purple traversed by the continual
stars.&rdquo;
