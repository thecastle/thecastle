Climbing is all about getting up. The trick is to ascend
vertically to the top with appropriate downward glances to check
the placement of the feet on foot holds, but without downward
movement of the rapid uncontrolled variety. Deviation from ascent
is permissible by traversing sideways, climbing down or
 abseiling, but certainly not by taking to the air and relying on
gravity.
</p>

<p>
The reasons for this are, of course, obvious. Firstly,
climbers are land creatures who do not possess wings, so any
attempts at aerobatics will inevitably result in a bumpy landing.
Secondly, the whole ethos of the sport of climbing is to get up.
To fall off is to repudiate this basic principle.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, the art of falling off is sometimes practised
by those who find themselves too stretched to continue upwards.
As with all good mountaineering clubs, The Castle is rife with
stories of those who have fallen off, ranging from the ones who
have got away with amazing scrapes and near misses to those who
have suffered more serious injuries. At various times battered
helmets and frayed ropes have been displayed in the clubroom,
whilst the fallen have themselves limped in on crutches, their
damaged limbs suitably encased in plaster.
</p>

<p>
The better practitioners of the art of falling off manage to
ensure, by the prior placement of adequate runners and a good
choice of second, the avoidance of contact either with rocks on
the face or the ground at the bottom, so that the fall is no more
than a mere dangle from the last runner. The less able
practitioners of the art fail to keep one or more of these points
in mind and so fail to achieve such an innocuous end result.
</p>

<p>
Some go quietly, others with much noise and commotion.
Witness the Club member who destroyed the Lakeland solitude on
Dow Crag by noisily dislocating his shoulder, the din of his
painful fall being equalled only by his protests at the rough and
ready on the spot reduction of the injury by a fellow Club
member. Some are not even content with a single incident but
insist on trying again: one notorious case insisted on returning
to the crags with his newly acquired pot only to chalk up another
fall to his portfolio and more Plaster of Paris to his person.
</p>

<p>
At this stage I have to declare my personal interest in the
matter and admit to belonging to the ranks of the fallen. My fall
was accomplished without noise or loud proclamation and I did at
least achieve dangle   only in my case the dangle was merely
momentary due to the runner not proving sufficient.
</p>

<p>
It all began innocently enough one sunny May afternoon.
First my left hand slipped off the rock followed by my right hand
and then by both feet. The books tell us that three points of
contact is the rule. And with no point of contact at all further
upwards progress becomes impossible. The result was the forbidden
condition of downward flight. As I saw terra firma approaching at
alarming speed with a painful impact seeming inevitable, my
reaction changed from mild surprise at my sudden airborne status
to abject terror. Contrary to folklore, my previous life did not
flash before me and events did not happen in slow motion. On the
contrary, I made contact with the ground at speed and the result
was both quick and painful. My landing was possibly the most
unskilful aspect of of all, following very much the traditional
warning of the result of a bad landing given to raw recruits in
the Paras: &ldquo;Toes, knees, hospital!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Well, there it is, my personal summary of the whys and
wherefores of falling off and how it has worked for me. It is an
activity which continues from year to year and is one which is
inseparable from climbing itself. Without the risk of falling off
there would be no being gripped, no adrenalin and no beer embellished
accounts of scrapes and near misses. Most of the
fallen do resume their climbing careers  some  as I have already
mentioned  even repeat the experience. Personally though, I have
succumbed completely to the downward urge and now practice the
art of caving.
