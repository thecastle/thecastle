Caving as a Club activity, first got on the official meets
list in winter 1983 84, though some members had "dabbled" some
years before when Geoff Tryon had organised a beginners' and an
advanced trip.
</p>

<p>
The first "official" trip, to Carl's Wark Cavern, was well
attended despite heavy snow in Sheffield, causing one car to have
an argument with a wall.
</p>

<p>
Conditions were wet underground and Steve Hartland led us
through a short low section where the immersion of one ear was
obligatory   great fun! We were out in time to get changed
 chilly in the snow  and go to the pub in Eyam for a lunch time
pint   all except Dunky who forgot his change of clothes and had
to drive straight home, only to be refused entry to his parent's
house  so legend has it  until he had stripped off in the garage.
</p>

<p>
After this success, the following winter saw two meets on
the list with trips to Giant's and P8. Since then there has been
at least one Club trip a year and a few members have got so keen
that they have used the excuse of "going caving" to avoid nasty
bog trots. However, there are still a few folks unconvinced of
the attractions of caving and the excuses for  not  going on caving
meets have ranged from "I'm frightened of lifts" through "I've
been caving with you once that's enough!" to "Not bloody likely!"
Some even prefer to go to a nice, warm climbing wall, to do a
twenty mile walk in the rain, or even to watch Ski Sunday in
front of the box. But you cannot really beat a trip underground
for sheer enjoyment, the peak of which is normally reached
belatedly, whilst clutching a hot toddy in the bath at home.
</p>

<p>
The point of least enjoyment is reached shortly after
leaving the cave and is characterised by the removal of wet,
muddy clothing or wetsuits in rather less than comfortable
temperatures and circumstances.
</p>

<p>
I can remember when Andy Smith during a particularly tight
squeeze had to strip off down to his undies in order to get
through. This was not the first time that Andy's size had created
problems, a classic example being his ascent of  Cave Climb  at
Chatsworth Edge. The finish of the route is very similar to
caving and involves clambering out of a closed chimney via a
small hole at the top. With his legs flapping, Andy's body was
well and truly stuck fast until Charles came to the rescue by
hoisting him out by his braces!
</p>

<p>
One of the most memorable Club trips for me was the January
'86 visit to Swinsto Hole in the Yorkshire Dales. The small but
elite !  team consisted of Marian Birkett, Dave Crowther, Mike
Doyle, Dave Pendlebury and myself. It was a miserable wet day so
we were cheered by the fact that we were not missing any
climbing! Less cheering was the sight of flooded fields, with
rivers and canals absolutely full to the brim   what was that I
had heard about the West Kingsdale master cave flooding to the
roof? And the warning in the guidebook that the exit through
Valley Entrance "sumps in wet weather"?
</p>

<p>
The plan was to abseil down all the seven or eight pitches
of Swinsto, pulling the ropes down after us   a trifle
committing! However, some precautions for our safe delivery from
the bottom were taken by Dave P and myself going into the Valley
Entrance beforehand and fixing a ladder down into the master
cave. I even went down it to see how much water there was in the
bottom: instead of the normal three or four inches it was about
two feet deep and moving at such a pace that walking upstream was
virtually impossible. Still, not to worry, we would be coming
downstream!
</p>

<p>
Back outside after fixing the ladder, we reassured the
others that the water was lovely and warm and that only a small
epic could be anticipated, then set off up the hill to Swinsto
Hole.
</p>

<p>
The cave started off as it meant to go on   wet! Straight
into a low, tight, stream passage and quickly to the first pitch
  an abseil down a waterfall! Then 900 feet of stooping and
hands and knees crawling in water, knee pads a definite
advantage! A short waterfall descent into a pool was followed by
a curtain pitch down another waterfall. It was interesting to
watch the different techniques employed by people as they
disappeared into the waterfalls in a welter of foam   Dave P.
used technique and control in an attempt to keep out of the water
as much as possible while Dave C. employed speed as his defence
against drowning. The problem was, the further down the cave we
went, the greater the volume of water!
</p>

<p>
By the time we reached the main pitch   two abseils, one of
fifty feet and one of forty split by a ledge   there was some
real force in the water. I abseiled first here as on all pitches
 the privilege of being leader!  and could not see the ledge at
all until I actually touched it.
</p>

<p>
A sort of weird of disco was danced by the team to the music
of crashing water in a sheltered recess at the foot of the main
pitch, in an attempt to regain some of the heat lost from
prolonged immersion. What we needed, obviously was an immersion
heater? Groan, groan!
</p>

<p>
Everybody got warmed up again on the next section   an
exciting stream passageway with rapids to clamber down, pools to
fall into and tight bits to squeeze through. Eventually we
reached the final chamber after our eighth abseil. Not far to the
master cave from here!
</p>

<p>
Off we went down the east entrance passage on our hands and
knees, through a low watery bit and on to a gravel bank. All this
I remembered from the last time I'd been here. What I did not
recognise was the sump, where the roof of the passage gradually
lowers to meet the water level. To cut a long story short, we
went back and forth along a section of the cave before the
correct route was finally located. Just enough uncertainty to get
the adrenalin pounding!
</p>

<p>
Back in the master cave, the water was flowing down a
veritable helter skelter channel. Mike and I leapt in and
vanished down the cascades before the others realised where we
had gone: I must take a rubber dinghy down there sometime, it
would be great fun.
</p>

<p>
One thing I'll never do again is to solo up a free hanging
Electron ladder with a rucksack containing 150 feet of wet rope
and several gallons of water!
</p>

<p>
Luckily the bit in the Valley Entrance that "in wet weather
usually sumps" had not: there was at least six inches of air
space!
</p>

<p>
Once outside, the fresh air was, as always, welcoming   even
though it was still raining. It was very satisfying to know that
the walkers would undoubtedly have got wet too.
