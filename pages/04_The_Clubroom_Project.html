</p>

<p>
It was in early July 1969, after two years of frustrating
and fruitless searching for a suitable clubroom, that Alec and
Colin were having lunch at The Rising Sun on Abbey Lane
Sheffield. Whilst discussing the Club with the licensee Ada
Bennett, they became aware of the dilapidated building behind the
Inn.
</p>

<p>
On examining the beautiful old building with its ivy covered
roof and fine stonework, it was immediately apparent that there
was great potential here in terms of the long awaited clubroom.
Interest was declared and Ada, although in favour of the
proposition, made it clear that the final decision must rest with
the Brewery and that they would need to get in touch with the
Brewery Manager.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, our friend Mike Collins was not only the
Brewery Manager but also a "regular" at The Castle Inn where the
Club was then still meeting. He immediately took up our cause and
his enthusiasm for the project was boundless. In August 1969,
Alec had talks at The Rising Sun with a local Director of the
Brewery and members of his works department.
</p>

<p>
It was originally intended to occupy only the top half of
the building which was formerly a corn and hay loft, but on
closer inspection the upper floor joists and floor boards were
found to be riddled with woodworm and would need to be entirely
replaced: even the external doors were hanging off their hinges.
After a quick inspection the parties were glad to retire to the
more congenial surroundings of the bar of The Rising Sun to
discuss the matter further.
</p>

<p>
Now Alec had always been a talkative type of person  the
less kind might call it verbal diarrhoea  but on this occasion
this characteristic proved an invaluable asset. Alec could not or
would not stop talking, the Director needed to get back to work
and in order to get away felt obliged to promise that the Brewery
would strip out the whole of the interior of the building and
make the property structurally sound. It was agreed by Ada that
the Club could then rent the premises at a nominal figure. By the
end of September 1969, the Brewery work had been completed and
the building was available for our use.
</p>

<p>
It was at this crucial juncture that Alec presented himself
at Mike Jackson's office and asked him if he would like to be
Hon. Secretary. Mike said "No!"  Alec, it appeared, had to move
back to Scotland for business reasons and therefore unfortunately
would not be able either to continue as Hon. Secretary or take
part in the building of the clubroom. It has long been rumoured
 and believed by the very best of his friends  that Alec had
asked for a transfer back north because he had guessed what might
be in store. He asked Mike again, praising his powers of
organisation, his loyalty and the need for a steady hand on the
tiller. Mike again said "No!"   even more definitely. The verbal
diarrhoea flowed and Mike just did not stand a chance. A new Hon.
Secretary was in the making.
</p>

<p>
Our initial aspirations for the clubroom were limited to a
casual use of the existing building, although we had vague hopes
that we might be able to use one gable end as a makeshift
climbing wall. We planned to utilise our camping equipment to
provide heat and light and simply to install a few items of
second hand furniture to be donated by the Brewery. During a
visit to collect benches and stools, we noticed that the staff
were taking up the old cobbled brewery courtyard which over the
generations had been tarred in place to take the weight of horse
drawn drays. This was an opportunity too good to miss and as the
cobbles came up they were delivered to the yard of The Rising
Sun. But the mass of filthy black stone grew to alarming
proportions and it was painfully obvious that a good many
generations of horses had passed over them and left their
deposits in more ways than one.
</p>

<p>
Now the Club was fortunate in having an architect in its
ranks in the form of Kerry Brooksbank and Kerry had kindly
offered to give us a hand. On our very first day of work we
gathered in the pub yard to be greeted by a huge pile of
exceedingly evil smelling tar and horse encrusted cobbles. We
were under the impression that all we were going to do was to
clean them up as best we could and stack them into place. How
could we have been so gullible?
</p>

<p>
Looking first at the cobbles and then at us, Kerry picked
one up. It was shaped somewhat like a loaf of bread, rounded at
the top and tapered on both sides. The wearing face had been
slightly fractured by horseshoes and wagon wheels. He turned the
stone over and to our surprise, struck it sharply with his
hammer.
</p>

<p>
With a cry of "That's it!" he stood there grinning.
</p>

<p>
"That's what?" we responded in unison.
</p>

<p>
"We face it."
</p>

<p>
"We what?"
</p>

<p>
"We chisel a face on every stone."
</p>

<p>
"Every stone?"
</p>

<p>
"Every one!"
</p>

<p>
What was the man talking about? He must be joking  or had he
just taken leave of his senses? Face it? All of it? Just thinking
about it almost made us walk off and leave him standing there. He
couldn't mean it: sentenced to hard labour and rock breaking
without trial. Our hobby was mountaineering, not serving time. He
couldn't be serious&#x2026; but he was. Every single stone was to be
cut to reveal the beautiful lines and colours beneath the grime.
All twenty tons of them.
</p>

<p>
Kerry immediately undertook to prepare detailed drawings for
a stone built clubroom and then to supervise all the building
work that would be entailed, essential if the enthusiasm of
members without any building experience whatsoever was to result
in a finished product worthy of themselves and the Club. Even
then, little did we realise just what Kerry had in mind and the
magnitude of the task we were about to undertake. It was not
until he presented us with a line drawing that the full extent of
his ambitions dawned on us.
</p>

<p>
His basic plan was to convert half the ground floor of the
building into a "snug" with a room above in which to store Club
equipment. His scheme called for a raised floor for the snug room
and a massive stone centre column with embedded flagstone steps
forming a staircase to the upper floor. The inside walls were to
be stripped back to the original stonework and the ceiling of the
snug was to be of new timber supported by two substantial beams,
all the woodwork to be varnished to enhance its appearance. A
fitted bookcase would not only house books, maps and climbing
guides but also separate the snug from a small galley  bench
seating, carpets and spotlights would finish the project. ,
Having decided what to do, it only remained to do it, easier
said than done. Where were the funds, materials and labour to
come from? The last was easily solved as Club members would of
necessity have to undertake the work themselves, but financing
the project would be  more difficult with the subscription only
 1 a year. As for materials, we already had our building stone
but a great deal more material would clearly be required and so
the scrounging began.
</p>

<p>
A friendly builder gave us permission to "cannibalise" an
old bungalow about to be demolished and one evening the
equivalent of a plague of locusts descended on the unfortunate
property. Under Kerry's direction, floors and quarry tiles came
up, joists came out, many a mile of electric wire was gathered
and the lead on the roof  already being eyed by local citizens
was stripped off. The entire booty was loaded in an assortment of
vehicles and the convoy set off for home well after dark. Kerry
brought back all the lead in a borrowed Land Rover, laden to the
wheel arches. Dressed in his glad rags, covered in dust and
without any form of identification, he could hardly be expected
even to remember the registration number. It seemed to us a shame
that he was not pulled up by the local Bobby. "You won't believe
this, Officer &#x2026;"
</p>

<p>
Over the coming months many members came to lend a hand, but
the dedicated hard core were to be seen on site several evenings
a week and most weekends. The major task involved cutting the
stone, mixing cement and building the central column with its
flagstone steps. The stone was so very hard that several blows
were required to achieve even one cut on the face of each cobble
but as we gradually grew more expert it became a joy to work
with, such was its superb quality.
</p>

<p>
You could always tell our stone masons by the large painful
bruises on their hands, the strained wrists and the blood stained
finger bandages where the hammer had missed the chisel. To cover
our embarrassment, we claimed that the injuries were hand jamming
scars! We soon became adept at technical jargon and spoke
knowingly but incomprehensibly of corbels, coigns, jumpers,
gobbo, compo and lump hammers. Our world revolved around the
four to one mix. Our shoes were disgusting, our finger nails were
full of cement and our hair varied from grey to white to brown to
grey as the dust and cement flew around. -
</p>

<p>
Throughout the building programme, every single bag of sand
and cement had to be purchased and  brought on site, water was
obtained by the bucket from Ada's outhouse and lighting was by a
single lamp. When it got too dark you went home. All cement had
to be mixed by hand and all stones first cut to size and then
laid to plan. After every building session, a return visit was
required in order to brush out the mortar joints and create a
marvellous three dimensional effect.
</p>

<p>
The hundred year old ivy, previously allowed to go its own
way, covered the entire roof and gave us a different type of
problem as it was growing through the stone roof tiles and
hanging down on the inside from the ceiling to the floor. The
ancient stems were so closely entwined that the mass of
vegetation had to be laboriously cut out in small pieces, so as
not to dislodge the tiles. This was very tough work indeed and
two particularly intricate pieces were preserved in order to
display them in the clubroom fireplace.
</p>

<p>
After a daily visit over a period of several weeks to a
church under demolition, we salvaged several carved feature
stones which were sand blasted and used to support the two main
beams supplied by our friendly builder. The doors and all the
window frames were taken out and replaced, the plumbing installed
and the entire building rewired to modern standards.
</p>

<p>
Saturdays, Sundays, club nights and any spare time went into
building work and slowly, very slowly, the project began to take
shape and to resemble the plan. We felt that we were now becoming
very professional and Kerry must have thought so too, for as the
work progressed and then neared its completion, he kept coming up
with another wall to be built or a corner to be faced with stone
and even a decorative archway.
</p>

<p>
All in all it was a very busy time but like all things it
thankfully came to an end. With the snug floor laid, the centre
column built, the galley completed and the upper floor in place,
all that remained was to provide the finishing touches. Kate Peek
hand carved an archway stone dated 1970 whilst Bryan Metcalf
created a copper Castle motif with crossed ice axes to decorate
the snug fireplace. Tables, benches and chairs had been provided
by the Brewery and the carpets, together with books, maps,
pictures and photographs, were donated by members to make the
clubroom all the more comfortable and welcoming. -
The entire building programme in all its variety and
complexity was carried out by our own enthusiastic and willing
Club members, albeit under Kerry's expert guidance. The standard
achieved with little or no previous experience in building no
doubt surprised even the members themselves. Starting from
Kerry's basic concept, the carrying out of the entire project has
proved so successful that no substantial alterations have been
required over the years and the clubroom today is as fine and as
practical as ever.
</p>

<p>
However, at that time the mountaineering enthusiasts had not
fully taken into account the doubts of a number of Castle Inn
"regulars" who could not bring themselves to accept the move from
their beloved watering hole. Even after an impassioned plea from
Alec in Scotland, the move was sanctioned by the committee only
on the casting vote of the President, a remarkable performance in
the light of the magnitude of the task already undertaken and
completed.
</p>

<p>
We were now committed irrevocably to the future of the Club
and its new clubroom which we intended to use as a springboard
for our outdoor activities. But could it be viable without the
support of those early members who had stayed at The Castle Inn?
It was a question we were to ask ourselves many times over, as on
our first club night at the clubroom, a grand total of eight
turned up. Thankfully, the enthusiasm of the loyal climbing and
hill walking members prevailed and as the advantages of having
our own clubroom and meeting place became more and more apparent,
so the membership again began to grow with a welcome influx of
keen climbers and hill walkers. On 21st April 1971 a grand
opening party was held when Sir Jack Longland officially opened
the clubroom and paid tribute to the hard work and achievement of
the members.
</p>

<p>
By now we were all not only climbing and walking the hills
at every opportunity but also starting families, building careers
and setting up businesses. Nevertheless, after only a year the
stalwarts began to get itchy fingers and to prepare plans for the
erection of a climbing wall on the inside of the empty gable end
a climbing wall to give members an opportunity to fill those dark
winter nights. We learned that two cottages were being demolished
and after negotiating for the stone, we organized a number of
lorries and a further twenty tons of large sandstone blocks were
loaded and delivered to the clubroom in one day.
</p>

<p>
WE WERE OFF AGAIN!
</p>

<p>
It was a peaceful Sunday morning when the first lorry
arrived to be unloaded by members. At first the stone was neatly
stacked, but the sheer volume soon overcame our efforts. The pile
grew higher and higher until it topped the boundary wall, itself
seven feet high, by some three feet. But the fully laden lorries
kept arriving.
</p>

<p>
At the height of this activity, Ada  who had in fairness to
the Hon. Secretary had been warned that "a few stones" might be
arriving  sallied forth to express her heartfelt indignation. As
she came into the yard, a very large lorry was noisily attempting
to extricate itself from the huge mass of stone in front and the
ever growing pile it was tipping behind. The  din and the clouds
of diesel fumes were absolutely appalling. The Hon. Secretary
 remember, he's the one who got talked into this job  looked
round for moral support from the loyal members busily working at
his side. He needn't have bothered: not one was to be seen and
Ada's considerable wrath descended on him unabated and at great
length. Mike is not very often lost for words but it would have
been easier for him to dam the Grand Canyon than to put up any
resistance. He listened, tried to look intelligent and said very
little, a ploy he had already tried out unsuccessfully on Alec.
Guilty as charged!
</p>

<p>
The stone masons were brought out of their happy retirement
and the building work began again. The climbing wall progressed
quickly, as it proved much easier working indoors with power and
water laid on.  Great attention was given to detail, with
undercut holds, hand jamming cracks and overhangs constructed to
the precise requirements of the climbers. The design incorporated
an open fireplace with a flue inside the wall, mischievously
described as the one and only centrally heated climbing wall! The
fireplace itself also serves to provide a genuine mantle shelf
start to the main face.
</p>

<p>
One last area remaining for improvement was the main
entrance. A canopy was built, stone flags laid and a stone
grinding wheel erected to provide a decorative finishing touch
with local interest, this being of course The Peak District ,
 National Park emblem. Kate, as artistic as ever, carved out a
second stone, this time dated 1972.
</p>

<p>
APRIL 26TH 1972   FINISHED!
</p>

<p>
No more stone to cut, no more fittings to fit, no more
mixing of cement and no more painting. Party time with a firkin
of ale, a whole range of goodies made by wives and girlfriends, a
time to celebrate. Sir Jack Longland came back to do the honours
and we were joined in our celebrations by representatives of the
Brewery, members of other climbing clubs, the Press and all who
had made our clubroom possible. The night was long and one to
remember.
</p>

<p>
Since then, members have been involved in the promotion of a
film in Sheffield depicting the local climbing scene and the
premiere of "Whillans on Everest" in 1971, a scoop for the Club
and, even if something of a gamble, a means of meeting our
building costs. They have taken an active part in the formation
of the Sheffield Association of Climbing Clubs  SACC  and have
extended a helping hand to many, including the hard lads from
London's East End who met their match on the local gritstone
Edges. Most of all it has been fun and our clubroom provides
unique and welcoming surroundings in which the members and their
friends can enjoy each other's company and plan their outdoor
activities.
</p>

<p>
Throughout the years, the Club has certainly seen many
changes in climbing techniques, from the early days when we filed
the threads out of nuts, to the high tech "Friends" of today. It
is not unusual these days to see a pair of bright pink tights on
the climbing wall on a club night, enhancing the style of their
proud owner. Progress, it would appear, comes in many forms. Even
the Club's newsletter is computerised: now there's progress!
</p>

<p>
Members can be found visiting all parts of the world ranging
from the Himalaya to the Antarctic, from South America to Africa
and from the Rockies to the Alps   a far cry from those early
days when each away meet was an adventure in itself and a meet in
Scotland the limit of our ambitions. With Alec starting a second
Castle Mountaineering Club in Edinburgh   yes, he's at it again!
  it only remains for Kerry  who moved to Johannesburg  and for
Kate and Alan  who moved to Norway  to do the same and we shall
truly enjoy worldwide connections. ,
Throughout the first twenty one years of its existence the
Castle has enjoyed the services of outstanding Club Officers who
have taken a full and active part in organising meets and
encouraging members new and old, ensuring the smooth running and
progress of the Club. The friendship and companionship of The
Castle Mountaineering Club are very special and just as members
have given their best efforts to the Club, so the Club has
brought together many people from different walks of life to
share the joys of climbing the crags and tackling the mountains.
</p>

<p>
The foundations of The Castle Mountaineering Club have been
well laid and with its unique features and the enthusiasm of its
members, its future is clearly secure.
