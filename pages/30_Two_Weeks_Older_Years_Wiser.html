<em>by Claire Coates</em>
</p>

<p>
Sitting in the warmth and comfort of my home, Alpine
adventure seems very far away indeed. Knowing the tricks that
memory and time can play, on countless occasions in the Alps last
summer I told myself sternly and fiercely, often through hot
tears:
        "You will remember how evil this feels. You will remember
that it's sheer hell."
</p>

<p>
I was very naive and unsuspecting when I left for the Alps
for the first time the previous July. Excited and apprehensive,
yes, but sure of myself. I knew the environment was dangerous
but, after all, I had prepared very carefully, I had trained, was
as fit as I had ever been in my life, had good safe equipment and
was to be coached through my first Alpine experiences by a
professional guide. I was looking forward to it very much.
</p>

<p>
I travelled out a few days early so had some time to spare
before I was due to join the guide. The campsite at Argentiere
had a lively, British, climbing community and those first few
days were easily filled, walking and climbing with new friends
and getting used to the Alpine scale of things. With two people
from the Red Rope MC I climbed the  Papillons Ridge  in fine
conditions, thoroughly enjoying the stunning positions and
interesting rock climbing. The altitude caused no problems,
neither did other first experiences like climbing with my
rucksack and long abseils. We had a long walk off the mountain
because we missed the last telepherique down to Chamonix, but it
was a delightful walk along green paths, made even better by
eating wild raspberries and listening to booming rock music
echoing up from a concert in the town below. It was a sound and
optimistic beginning.
</p>

<p>
My guide was in fact the only British woman qualified as a
guide, well respected and with a great deal of experience of
Alpine courses. She worked with Tim, a good, strong climber who
also knew the Alps well. The two people in the group with me the
first week were a married couple, Karen and Kevin, who had walked
in the Alps before but had little climbing experience. The second
week we were joined by two men with a burning ambition to reach
the summit of Mont Blanc  nothing else, just that. John and Ron
had virtually no experience of any climbing and I had never set
foot in the mountains on snow or ice before. A challenge to the
sturdiest of teachers, I would say! Little did we know what fate
had in store for us.
</p>

<p>
We began our training on the Mer de Glace. Those of you who
are familiar with Chamonix will know that there is a perfectly
good train which takes you  and hundreds of tourists  to
Montenvers, only a short walk from the glacier. But for us,
walking was not to be shirked. What's more, I foolishly wore my
new plastic boots   personal torture chambers which pull you down
with every step and slowly pot roast your feet. By the time we
reached the glacier, what with the boots, a rucksack that was far
too heavy, the steepness of the hill and dehydration, I felt as
if I were going to die. It was a sensation I was going to get
used to. Donning crampons for the first time, I felt about ten
months old, learning to walk again. Small, tentative steps,
scowling at our guide when she shouted at me to jump around.
Then, in order to practice, we walked unroped around the glacier,
picking our way over crevasse bridges, up and down slopes   very,
very, slowly. Fear seemed to have stolen my sense of balance. We
stopped to do some rope work and learn safety techniques,
including crevasse rescue. One by one we played rescuer and
rescued. Weighing much less than the others, it seemed at times
that my legs and back would snap. I moaned, a lot.
</p>

<p>
I was encouraged because for the next couple of days we were
to leave the ice and turn to rock. We did two long routes on the
Massif des Aiguilles Rouges, bivvying overnight at the Index
station. At this time there was very little snow and the normally
snow covered gullies were full of hot, broken rocks which took
you sliding back as you tried to make upward progress. Soul
destroying. Back breaking. Painful. The rock climbing was sweet
release, technically easy and in fine weather. At the end of the
rope I was left to my own devices and I enjoyed the marvellous
views and some relaxation.
</p>

<p>
Following this, on our fourth day we set off for the snow,
planning to do the Petite Aiguille Verte on the way to the
Argentiere hut. Unfortunately I was struck with altitude sickness
on the ascent and had to be left sitting on a rock in the hot sun
watching enviously as the others went on up to their first "snow"
summit. The sickness became worse and I made the arduous trek to
the hut feeling only semi conscious and in need of a great deal
of support. Staying in the hut brought more new experiences   a
whole new regime. There was so much to remember, like getting
water for the next day in case the pipes froze overnight and
arranging your gear so that nothing was forgotten or lost. I was
thrown into a permanent state of panic.
</p>

<p>
At 3 am, a gentle whistle roused our dormitory and,
bleary eyed, we prepared for the day. It took us forty minutes and our
guide was furious   we would have to manage in a third of the
time in future! So, late, we set off for the Aiguille Tour Noir.
Before long, unable to keep up and still feeling sick and dismal,
I lost sight of the others. I had come to the Alps hoping to
learn to love the mountains and I was beginning to hate them.
Once again I was left behind, this time in pitch darkness and
freezing cold, waiting for dawn so that I could safely return to
the hut and all the while wondering if I could afford the air
fare home. I felt a mixture of disappointment, frustration, anger
and fear. But if I thought that I would be let off that lightly,
I was wrong. The next day we were marshalled swiftly out   I
think I slept in everything except my glacier cream   and even
did without a drink or a visit to the toilet to be ready in time.
After much faltering, cajoling, complain ing and encouraging, by
mid morning I had reached the summit of the Aiguille
d'Argentiere. What an enormous sense of relief and achievement. I
didn't want to go home any more.
</p>

<p>
The elements then decided to intervene and we had two days
of continuous torrential rain, which meant one day's rest and one
day in a flood on the Bossons glacier, trying to front point up
the steep sides of crevasses as water poured down sleeves,
gloves, trousers and socks and lightning cracked around us. Only
when we had achieved what we had come for were we allowed to
retreat to the Bar Nationale. Once down to the car, I incurred
our guide's wrath and a new reputation by removing all my clothes
at the roadside. Dry clothes seemed worth any consequences.
</p>

<p>
We spent the next night at the Albert Premier hut and
although a snowstorm delayed our start we conquered the West and
South Summits of the Aiguille de Tour. After a great day rock
climbing at Les Gaillands, which reminded me of home and restored
some confidence, we set off for our last expedition. We were to
do part of the Midi Plan, bivvy in the Midi station and tackle a
final route on the morning of the day we were due to travel home,
leaving Chamonix at noon. Quite a schedule.
</p>

<p>
There had been extremely heavy snowfalls up high   the
 Papillons Ridge  I had rock climbed only days before was covered
in snow. With hindsight, we should not have attempted the Midi Plan
in those conditions, with deep snow blocking the normal
route. We soon ran into trouble, confronted by difficult,
technical, rock climbing in full ice gear. It was a traumatic and
dangerous time, ending in an abseil escape and retreat to the
Midi station. This experience played a large part in my choice of
route for the following day. Half of the group was to tackle the
the Cosmiques Ridge , whilst Tim would do Mont Blanc de Tacul. I had
no desire to repeat the events of the Midi Plan and was very keen
to climb over 4000m, so I chose to go with Tim. We had a
magnificent meal in our comfortable bivvy and enjoyed a superb
sunset. Spirits were high.
</p>

<p>
 At 3 am Tim, Ron and I set off, leaving the others
sleeping. The ascent was marvellous. By this time I was beginning
to get fit enough and we progressed quickly, leaving two parties
from Cardiff University in our wake. Despite the deep new snow we
were on the summit before 7 am, accompanied by a very spectacular
dawn. I felt on top of the world. Beginning our descent, we
passed the other British groups and reached the top of the main
slab.
</p>

<p>
Imagine making your way gingerly down a narrow ice ledge,
balanced on crampon points and ice axe, expectantly working your
way towards the safety of the snow slope. And then&#x2026;&#x2026;. that
slope moves, lifts itself from the face of the earth and hurls
itself down the mountainside. Half a mile of snow, at least
twenty feet deep, suddenly erupting, causing a thunderous roar.
Nothing in the path of that avalanche could have survived. It was
a monster. A monster no more than fifty feet away. Tim screamed
at us and literally dragged Ron and myself back up the ice ledge
away from the chaos beside us. I have never, ever, been so
frightened.
</p>

<p>
But the trauma had only just begun. How were we to get off
the mountain? As we stood debating the horrific options with the
other groups who had reached us by this time, a French policeman
was dropped from a helicopter. His interest, understandably, was
to discover if there had been anyone on the slab. Miraculously
there had not. He offered no advice as to our descent   we were
the mountaineers he said, we should tell him! He would be willing
to pick up our bodies if we risked triggering another avalanche
on the cracked and unstable slab, but he was not interested in us
alive. Fortunately common sense prevailed. It had been the
largest avalanche of the summer there and to have had to deal
with nine British bodies would have been inconvenient. So, the
helicopter came back and in circumstances that seemed more
appropriate to the television screen, we were whisked from the
mountain top to the valley.
</p>

<p>
The weird helicopter flight which seemed to turn the world
upside down and the sight of rescue workers  and dogs on the mass
of broken snow brought home the awful reality of it all and I
cried and cried. We should have been dead. Hesitat ing on the
summit for a final photograph, stopping to adjust my crampon,
moving so slowly on that ledge   the reasons we hadn't been swept
away came back to us in the sudden realization of what might have
been. We had to walk from the Vallee Blanche back to the Midi
station, interrupted mid way by another policeman, dropped from a
helicopter with more questions. The other party, who knew we had
reached the summit because they had watched our head torches in
the early morning, had witnessed the whole affair but could not
know we were safe until we arrived back. Their relief was almost
as great as ours.
</p>

<p>
I was glad to say goodbye to the Alps. They had been hostile
and frightening for much of my time there. I had felt bullied and
lonely and longed for the security of The Peak District, my home
and friends. Without pressure from our guide I would undoubtedly
have given in many times to physical discomfort and cowardice. As
it was, we had achieved an incredible amount in the time
available. Despite the aggressive conditions, I had learnt and
achieved more than I had thought possible   about climbing, the
mountains and most of all myself, what I am capable of and what
my true limitations are. For the future I know I must be
stronger, fitter, more determined and more self reliant to
survive in the mountains, and even then it will still be hard. I
have just finished reading "The White Spider" which chronicles
the savage history of the North Face of the Eiger. In spite of my
experien ces in the Alps I felt inspired and challenged by those
awesome tales, not intimidated and frightened. Perhaps those
tricks of time and memory have won after all. Or perhaps that's
the magic of mountaineering.
