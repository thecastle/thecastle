<p>
A summer evening&rsquo;s gritstone climbing   what more could you
ask for? Hilary and I walked up to the &ldquo;Unconquerable&rdquo; area of
Stanage to meet various friends. Pippa and Lisa were just
starting  Right Unconquerable   HVS . I had made the mistake of
climbing  Little Unconquerable  once before, a VS overhanging
gritstone crack, so that was out. What was left? Well, that was
it -  Left Unconquerable , E1 5b   a route I&rsquo;d been eyeing up for
some time.
</p>

<p>
The short crack which it shares with  Right Unconquerable
leads to a small ledge, then the crack continues steeply to some
overlaps. The next bit, a sort of awkward lay away, is the crux
after that, big holds up the final steep section lead to the top.
</p>

<p>
I unpacked my sack. I&rsquo;d just bought some new rock boots,
B3s, only  Â£25  I can&rsquo;t resist a bargain!  but I hadn&rsquo;t tried them
out yet. Lisa was amazed that I was going to wear them for the
first time on this particular climb. I reasoned that they had to
be better than my Crag Rats and that I needed all the help I
could get. I&rsquo;d been away and hadn&rsquo;t climbed on gritstone for some
weeks.
</p>

<p>
I started badly. I took at least ten goes to climb the first
short  supposedly straightforward  crack. The boots were
incredibly uncomfortable: why do they always feel alright when
walking round the shop? I started up the steep crack, putting
lots of runners in   I&rsquo;d got far too much gear as usual, so I
might as well get rid of it. By the time I&rsquo;d reached the overlap
my arms were screaming   I spent a while getting Friends in the
horizontal crack and then my ethical stance lowered somewhat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can you hold me on the rope, Hilary?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Oh, the relief of being able to let go with my hands! A good
while later, I&rsquo;d rehearsed in my mind the moves I needed to make
and psyched myself up ready to go.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;OK Hilary, I&rsquo;ll have another go!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
First get the feet in the longitudinal crack   another small
ledge a bit higher, lay away with the left hand , reach up with
the right   not much of a hold that! Now, keep going   another
couple of moves and I&rsquo;d reached the big jug with my left hand
marvellous, I&rsquo;d done it. Or had I? I just needed to get  my left
foot up on that hold and it was still some inches away. My hands
wouldn&rsquo;t work: I was staring at my fingers willing them to stay
there but I saw them slowly uncurling. Whoosh! Suddenly I was
twenty feet lower down, hanging upside down, staring stupidly at
Hilary. She had been sitting down and had been lifted off her
feet as I fell. I felt surprisingly little jolting  it was the
first time I&rsquo;d fallen when leading unless you count a fall from
about eight feet up a route when my landing was cushioned by my
second&rsquo;s head . I swung the right way up, pulled myself back to
the steep crack, clipped into a runner and hung there to take the
weight off Hilary and to have a rest. So near and yet &#x2026;
</p>

<p>
The others were hoping I&rsquo;d give up. The midges were biting
and the pubs were open. No chance! I knew I could do it. I&rsquo;d done
the hard move. I&rsquo;d just have to do it quicker so I didn&rsquo;t run out
of strength next time.
</p>

<p>
By this time Pippa had completed  Right Unconquerable  and so
had Lisa. They were getting ready to go. Pippa, thinking that
Hilary would like a rest after belaying me for about an hour,
took over from her. I struggled back up the crack to the overlap.
I was trying to conserve energy as my hope of a clean ascent was
now long gone and I rested often. At the overlap I rested a good
while on a runner, long enough to thoroughly bore Pippa, who now
handed over to Lisa   my third second on this one route.
</p>

<p>
Realising it was getting dark and that the pubs would soon
be shut, I gathered my energies for a final assault. Where were
those hand holds? There&rsquo;s the jug! Now, fingers, STAY WHERE
YOU&rsquo;RE PUT this time. Will my foot reach that hold? Yes! Made it!
</p>

<p>
I collapsed, puffing and panting, above the crux.
Encouraging noises floated up from below. Just the last bit now.
Let&rsquo;s get a runner in   don&rsquo;t want to do that again. Suddenly,
there I was at the top, a slight breeze trying to blow away the
midges. Up came Hilary and Lisa, congratulating me. My first E1
on grit. Maybe I&rsquo;ll do one properly some day.
