"Esoteric" may well describe some of the rock climbs in the
Central Wales Dolgellau area and the selection that the weather
permitted us to savour over the May Day Bank Holiday ranged from
the sublime   Will o' the Wisp   to the ridiculous   Gorilla's
Armpit     but more of that later.
</p>

<p>
Frank and Jennifer Mellor went down on Friday morning and
were so amazed to find the sun shining in Wales that they felt
they had to bag  Will o' the Wisp   Hard V Diff   the "Classic
Rock" route  while they could. They had the crag to themselves!
Marian Birkett, Chris Wright and I met them in The Cross Foxes
that evening and Charles Knowles and John turned up soon after.
</p>

<p>
Saturday morning had us somewhat aghast   sunshine and puffy
white clouds. The setting of the campsite at Cwmrhyddfor in these
conditions seemed idyllic. Ian Lauriston and Steve Hartland
turned up while we were breakfasting, followed shortly by Hilary,
Rosy and Andy. The vote went overwhelmingly for  Will o' the Wisp
with Frank and Jennifer opting for a day on Cader Idris.
</p>

<p>
Round in Cwm Cywarch there were some tense moments as the
teams battled to be first on  Will o' the Wisp . It seemed that the
Whitaker Birkett Wright team would win, having set off first from
the campsite, but stunning views up the Cywarch valley had caused
a halt at the roadside  for photography and as a result the
Lauriston Hartland team arrived at the parking spot only a short
while after them and raced off towards the crag whilst I was
looking for my boots. However, in the end Ian must have lost his
competitive concentration and I was able to sneak up the first
pitch trailing the ropes while Marian was still putting on her
EBs. As it happened there was no queueing and Chris soloed along
quite happily behind us. With the arrival of Charles, John,
Hilary, Andy and Rosy there was not a single pitch of  Will o' the
Wisp  which was not being climbed on by the CMC at the same time
as the first team arrived back at the sacks, the last one was
just leaving the ground! The route was accomplished without fuss
by all members and we won't mention the top rope that Charles had
on the "rib" pitch. Oops, sorry Charles!
</p>

<p>
After that Steve and Chris turned to the harder stuff before
being rained off on  Acheron. Marian, Ian and I went off in search
of  Gem   Hard Severe  performing a sheep rescue en route. This
route was made most memorable by the two seconds indulging in a
whimpering contest and comparing notes on every stance about why
they felt they should retire from climbing. The crux pitch
brought the whimpering to a crescendo but nobody actually fell
off, thanks to the "talking upwards" performed by those holding
the ropes above. However, my suggestion that we should follow
this with VS the girdle traverse of Tap Rhygan Ddu was greeted
with a show of apathy that bordered on the brink of flat refusal,
so I abandoned the project. Competition then became quite fierce
as to which one would  not  do another route with me. My suggestion
of a VS had left me with no one to climb with, so I compromised
with a Hard V Diff. Suddenly, they both didn't mind climbing
again, so we raced off up to  Jack of Diamonds .
</p>

<p>
We arrived at the start just ahead of Andy and Rosy, who had
been climbing  Incapability   Mod  just ahead of Charles, John and
Hilary. It was now looking as if it were about to rain, so Ian
dropped out and Marian and I set off. Halfway up the second pitch
the downpour started and the CMC were soon in full flight,
abseiling from everything in sight. Except, that is, for Marian
and I, somewhat more committed and for whom getting off seemed as
much of a problem as carrying on   so we carried on. As it turned
out, the deluge was only a passing torrent and it stopped soon
after we had reached our sacks.
</p>

<p>
Back at the campsite, the field had become a sea of mud and
I was rather surprised to find the car's back end overtaking me
as I swung up the hill to the tent. I never did get the car back
up that hill! Our chosen pub was chiefly memorable for its awful
beer   we'll remember not to go there again.
</p>

<p>
During the night the rain set in and the next morning there
was a marked absence of enthusiasm to leave the pit. As I
expected, the "mountaineers"  Andy, John, Hilary, Rosy and
Charles  set off up Cader Idris leaving the crag rats and Frank
and Jennifer to elect for "a day at the seaside". We rendezvoused
in Towyn at lunch time, a good enough excuse for a visit to the
chippie   rather interesting pasties and bright green peas! For
the afternoon's entertainment we relied on Marian's age and
experience: from the depths of ancient history, almost before
time began, she remembered going on a rock climbing course when
she'd been taken  to a small training crag on a beach, somewhere
near Towyn. So we set off for crag X and with remarkable speed
and accuracy, were soon at the foot of a small but fine little
sea cliff with clean solid rock  albeit a little wet  and lots of
excellent little lines and problems. There was even a climbing
course of young lads and lasses in residence to provide further
entertainment. Soon everyone was engrossed in leading, seconding,
top roping or soloing, enjoying themselves so much that the
weather gave up in disgust and the rock dried out.  By about five
o'clock most of the obvious lines  and some of the climbers  were
exhausted.
</p>

<p>
Steve and Ian headed back to Sheffield, but the rest decided
to sneak a route on Bird Rock whilst the weather wasn't looking.
Frank and Jennifer climbed  The Buttress   V Diff  and Marian and I
went for an amazingly steep route called  The Jug   Severe . Whilst
this was in progress the mountaineers turned up, having had a
good day on Cader. The pub at Abergynolwyn was a great success
more friends of Marian's arrived to swell the numbers and a good
long evening's boozing was enjoyed by all.
</p>

<p>
It rained most of Sunday night but had the decency to stop
when it was time to get up, breakfast and pack. The mountaineers
went off to sample Marian's sea cliffs, Frank and Jennifer went
for a bike ride and we headed for Bird Rock again. This crag has
a propensity for excessive steepness   disconcerting until you
discover that it has a fair number of large, juggy holds on it.
Unfortunately, a high percentage of these seem to be inadequately
secured to the rock face and one at least is secured no longer,
having parted company when I was clutching it, with the
inevitable effect of causing me to execute a swift flight through
space before a friendly Moac helped me to resist gravity's
summons. Unfortunately, my other hand had been stuffed up a
particularly sharp crack when I was betrayed by this hold and as
a result I finished the route using blood for aid  it gives
better adhesion than chalk!  I fell off the most  solid  pitch of
an HVS called  Gorilla's Armpit   even the name is enough to put
you off!   Ollie's pitch was a real frightener, swinging across
on massive, apparently unsupported, blocks. I was glad to make it
the last route of the holiday.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Chris and Dave attacked  The Bolero   HVS   and
Spike Wally   VS  and Lisa, Pippa and Marian formed a Cordee
Feminine for  The Diagonal   Severe  and  Siesta   Severe . A good
time was had by all and by all accounts we had better weather in
Wales than was to be had in the Peak   can you believe that?
