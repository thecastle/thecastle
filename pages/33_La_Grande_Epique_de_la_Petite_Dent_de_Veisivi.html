<p>
A cautionary tale of the Western Pennine Alps, to be read
aloud in an accent appropriate to that well-known Russian
Yorkshireman  pretender to the throne , now resident high
above the Arolla valley, Aiguille de t&rsquo;Csar.
</p>


<p class="verse">
<br  />
&ldquo;The Dent de Veisivi&rsquo;s an excellent climb&rdquo;<br  />
Read JB from out of his book<br  />
&ldquo;If we do it tomorrow there&rsquo;ll be plenty of time<br  />
To get back to the campsite and cook.&rdquo;<br  />
<br  />
At quarter past nine we started our way,<br  />
By nine seventeen we were lost<br  />
The path on the map was as clear as the day,<br  />
But not on the ground  to our cost .<br  />
<br  />
We swarmed up a gully that were filled up with boulders<br  />
To get to the path at the top<br  />
The sacks on our backs were hurting our shoulders,<br  />
So we thought it were time for a stop.<br  />
<br  />
We had our first lunch-break at quarter to ten,<br  />
The second at ten forty-four.<br  />
We were nearing the col by two, but by then<br  />
We had needed to have several more.<br  />
<br  />
We had planned the classic Veisivi traverse,<br  />
But JB felt a need for his bed<br  />
And the weather was making a change for the worse,<br  />
So we took the direct route instead.<br  />
<br  />
JB having gone, there were five of us left,<br  />
So we put on our boots and the rope.<br  />
The rucksacks were stowed in a deep rocky cleft<br  />
And we carried on climbing the slope.<br  />
Dave rounded a corner to find a wide path:<br  />
There were goats and a firework and all.<br  />
&ldquo;Oh heck, I&rsquo;m embarrassed&rdquo;, he said with a laugh,<br  />
&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t need the ropes here at all!&rdquo;<br  />
<br  />
But Dave was quite wrong - as we later found out -<br  />
For he scampered the ridge with much glee.<br  />
Then he looked up in terror as he heard Maxi shout<br  />
&ldquo;&rsquo;Ere, this side&rsquo;s as loose as can be!&rdquo;<br  />
<br  />
Dave soloed on up to check out the top<br  />
And were about to turn back when he saw<br  />
A bright shiny peg there gleaming in t&rsquo;rock,<br  />
And he thought, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have that for sure&rdquo;.<br  />
<br  />
And once on the top Dave discovered<br  />
The route we&rsquo;d been missing all day.<br  />
&ldquo;Our fortunes can now be recovered,&rdquo;<br  />
He said, &ldquo;by going back down the right way.&rdquo;<br  />
<br  />
Like sheep the rest of us followed,<br  />
But the last of us had to beware:<br  />
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll clean up this crag&rdquo;, Maxi hollered,<br  />
As he threw half the face to Haudres.<br  />
<br  />
Person by person we reached the summit,<br  />
Each shivering down to the bone.<br  />
The guidebook descent was a plummet,<br  />
So we chose a new route of our own.<br  />
<br  />
It were Max that found the creaky old post,<br  />
Which he said, in his judgement, were sound.<br  />
And by total agreement  well, total almost<br  />
It were Dave that checked out the ground.<br  />
<br  />
Max tied the ropes and made ready<br  />
For Dave&rsquo;s abseil down into space.<br  />
It were spaghetti that made him unsteady,<br  />
And in consequence, slowed down his pace.<br  />
He wanted to get to a ledge far below,<br  />
But for this did not hold much hope.<br  />
As his retro-rockets were starting to blow<br  />
He made it, with one inch of rope.<br  />
<br  />
The rest of us followed at varying pace,<br  />
Though two gave cause for a frown:<br  />
For Nige gave a swing with his boots in Dave&rsquo;s face<br  />
And Max was discarding his down.<br  />
<br  />
The rest of the route was quite easy,<br  />
But for a loose rock and a goat.<br  />
The former made Max feel right queasy,<br  />
The latter brought threats from Dave&rsquo;s throat.<br  />
<br  />
We were safe, so we thought, at the end of the day,<br  />
Little knowing what was to come yet.<br  />
Dave and Max  the two fastest  were sent on their way,<br  />
As the sun was beginning to set.<br  />
<br  />
Their mission was simple: to let JB know<br  />
The party was safe and complete<br  />
By the light of a head-torch they were spotted below<br  />
By JB  who was waiting to eat .<br  />
<br  />
The rest of the party  that&rsquo;s John, Nige and Chris<br  />
Were past the half-way point, but then<br  />
While deep in the woods the path they did miss<br  />
And the epic began once again.<br  />
<br  />
They stumbled and fumbled and tumbled their way<br  />
Down boulder-strewn slopes in the dark<br  />
Through wild undergrowth, which in dense thickets lay,<br  />
Indelibly leaving their mark.<br  />
<br  />
They were going great guns when encountered a hitch:<br  />
In their way was a wild waterfall.<br  />
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be tricky to get down this pitch -<br  />
Let&rsquo;s go to the left, by the wall.&rdquo;<br  />
They slid down wet rock with a stick for a brake<br  />
And slithered o&rsquo;er chalky-white grit.<br  />
Nige went on ahead, a recce to take<br  />
Saying, &ldquo;You two wait here for a bit.&rdquo;<br  />
<br  />
He said it were good, but a pine tree caught John,<br  />
And got him caught up in its roots,<br  />
And when he got free, t&rsquo;was a rhododendron<br  />
That next took a shine to his boots.<br  />
<br  />
The next obstacle of which they fought shy<br  />
Was a rock wall of handholds quite bare,<br  />
When all of a sudden a voice from on high<br  />
Said, &ldquo;What are you doing down there?&rdquo;<br  />
<br  />
T&rsquo;was Maxi-the-million who came to their aid,<br  />
Having left John and Dave in a bar.<br  />
He&rsquo;d expected the trio the bridge would have made<br  />
By the time he returned with the car.<br  />
<br  />
He&rsquo;d noticed, however, the lights in the wood<br  />
Had not moved very far since he left,<br  />
So he started on upwards as fast as he could,<br  />
His three friends to pluck from the cleft.<br  />
<br  />
He ran up and down, up the zig and the zag,<br  />
&ldquo;Where are you? Where are you?&rdquo; he cried.<br  />
The trio were hidden behind their rock crag,<br  />
&ldquo;We are here, over here!&rdquo; they replied.<br  />
<br  />
So nearly united were Max and the three,<br  />
Only needing their two paths to meet:<br  />
They skirted the rock-face to find themselves free<br  />
And with grateful rejoicing did greet.<br  />
<br  />
When the foursome returned, at last, to the road,<br  />
On the car was a bottle of beer<br  />
And a note saying &ldquo;We are preparing a load<br  />
Of food at the camp - see you there.&rdquo;<br  />
For JB and Dave, having found that the bar<br  />
Offered nothing whatever to eat,<br  />
Had returned to the campsite and cooked up pasta<br  />
And something resembling dog meat.<br  />
<br  />
Now, you may think this epic was ended,<br  />
But once again you would be wrong,<br  />
For Max in the front seat descended<br  />
To find he was no longer strong.<br  />
<br  />
His strength had been sapped by the rescue<br  />
And before we were able to go,<br  />
He needed to wait for a great spew<br  />
&#xa0;Which took half an hour or so .<br  />
<br  />
Smooth and fast, Chris drove through the night<br  />
&#xa0;For Max had requested, &ldquo;Be quick!&rdquo;<br  />
But before they could get to the campsite<br  />
He was once again terribly sick.<br  />
<br  />
They stopped by the Hotel de Tsa<br  />
&#xa0;Where Nige had now met up with Dave :<br  />
Poor Maxi crawled out of the car<br  />
Looking fit to drop into his grave.<br  />
<br  />
Dave got down on his hands and his knees<br  />
To where Max was lying quite bent.<br  />
He said, &ldquo;Will you come with me please -<br  />
I&rsquo;ll help you get back to your tent.&rdquo;<br  />
<br  />
With Max sound asleep in his bed,<br  />
The rest of us ate the dog meat,<br  />
Feeling restful and very well fed<br  />
And happy we&rsquo;d finished the feat.<br  />
<br  />
It were then that a bright flash were seen<br  />
And a loud bang from the cooker resounded:<br  />
In the grill-pan a lighter had been.<br  />
Is this epic for ever unbounded?<br  />
At two in the morning we lay down to sleep,<br  />
Our bodies all weary and battered.<br  />
The moral was simple: when climbing a heap<br  />
To take the right path was what mattered.<br  />
<br  />
De duddly duddly duddly da,<br  />
De duddly duddly dee,<br  />
De diddly diddly diddly da,<br  />
&#xa0;This last verse were writ by JB.<br  />
<br  />
There&rsquo;s a secondary moral to learn from this tale,<br  />
Which at times has seemed quite a tangle,<br  />
For odes by committee can turn you quite pale,<br  />
Putting ears, tongue and brain through a mangle.<br  />
<br  />
So don&rsquo;t write a poem to add to folklore<br  />
Unless you have nothing to do,<br  />
For each verse will take you ten minutes or more,<br  />
And this one is verse forty-two.<br  />
<br  />
