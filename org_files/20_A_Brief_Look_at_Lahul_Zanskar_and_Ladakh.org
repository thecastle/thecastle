* A Brief Look at Lahul, Zanskar and Ladakh
by
Jack Ashcroft

If you glance at a map of the Himalaya, extending across to
the north of India, it is approximately 900 miles between Godwin
Austen  K2  in the Karakoram and Everest in Nepal   much the same
distance as from north to south of The British Isles. The terrain
of the landscape contrasts vividly in both cases, but the tract
of country between K2 and Everest is the greatest contrasting
landscape in the world  it ranges from tropical forests to
mammoth rivers and contains the  world's highest snow  and
ice clad mountains from which issue the world's longest non polar
glaciers. It also includes the high plateau desert landscape that
characterises the country of Ladakh, close to the Karakoram.
Ladakh is a very dry area, as indeed is the Karakoram itself.
However, the mountain peaks of both Ladakh and neighbouring
Zanskar rarely reach 7,000m whilst those of the Karakoram exceed
8,000m, giving that little extra precipitation.

If you wish to visit the Himalaya during July and August,
the areas of Ladakh, Zanskar and the adjacent province of Lahul
and Spiti are the places to plan for. The further east you go
towards Nepal, the more rain you can expect in the monsoon
period.

Enough of this meandering introduction  suffice to say that
with August our only choice of holiday, Harry Woods and I planned
a trek in 1982 through the Zanskar Valley from Lahul to Kishtwar.
We covered 180 miles in just under three weeks over the Shingo La
 5,096m  to Padam  3,600m , the capital of the Zanskar Valley and
then out again over the Umasi La  5,300m   an eight day trek of
contrasting terrain, from the desert like landscape of Zanskar
through lush green forested gorges down to Kishtwar.

General Bruce, having reached a 20,000ft summit to the east
of the Shingo La in 1912 wrote:
 "Zanskar to the west, though bare enough  compared to his
view east  in all conscience, is wild, broken and savage to a
degree  a more inhospitable country it would be hard to find  but
some of the peaks are fine and boldly shaped... the great
difficulty in Zanskar... is the number of streams to be
negotiated... its intense savageness attracted me."
He goes on to say that the people who live there must be
very hardy and able to withstand great cold.

It is this country one enters on the ten day trek from
Darcha, the police post in Lahul, to Padam. Our trek also
included a diversion to visit Phuktal, the most impressive
monastic site in Zanskar. Bruce pointed out that the country is
"wild and broken"   but that the people are reasonably kind and
interesting, inhabiting the highest settlements of any size in
the world.

Kargiakh and Thangso at 4,200m over the Shingo La have no
doubt been the frontier posts between  Zanskar and Darcha for
thousands of years and only recently has the policing stance been
eased. This is indeed a dry and bleak environment, certainly the
most spartan I have encountered in my three visits to the region
but welcome after the three day trek through the virtually
uninhabited country from Darcha and its many "streams to be
negotiated".

Michel Peissel, an anthropologist much travelled in the
Himalaya, gives good insight into the Ladakhi character. His book
"Zanskar   the Hidden Kingdom" is a very readable description of
a walk through Zanskar, only two or three years after Ladakh was
opened to tourism, the borders having been closed by the Indian
authorities from the end of the Second World War.

There is much to write about in nearly three weeks travel
through these ancient sparsely populated valleys, but suffice to
say that it was a pleasant relief and a revelation to walk into
Padam having followed wild and broken gorge after gorge for over
a week. Padam, with its population of a thousand or so, is the
capital of Zanskar   effectively half way along a hanging valley
some eighty miles long with oasis like settlements surrounded by
mainly dry, barren, mountains. The only ways out lie over passes
of some 4,000m to 5,000m to the north, south and west. To the
east is the outlet of the Zanskar River, not a feasible route in
summer, we were told, but in winter becoming a hundred mile
frozen highway giving access from Padam to Leh  the Capital of
Ladakh  and the confluence with the embryonic Indus far to the
north. Peissel's description of Zanskar   "The Hidden Kingdom"
is indeed an apt one.

We stayed in Padam for two days and then set out on our
eight day trek over the Umasi La to Kishtwar and Kashmir. The
Umasi La is a more serious pass than the Shingo La and is
surrounded by interesting peaks. It had been our intention to
camp for two nights high on the pass with a peak in mind but this
was not to be. We climbed to the pass near the summits but only
stayed for twenty minutes as the weather was blowing in from the
valleys of Kashmir. We resolved to get down the glacier on the
far side as soon as possible rather than camp high, an hour's
descent through jumbled ice falls and moraine snow in poor
visibility.

What were the highlights of our trek? Perhaps "highlights"
is the wrong description, but the contrasting temperatures in
Zanskar certainly come to mind   from one hundred degrees
fahrenheit at high noon to below freezing at nights  the Buddhist
culture in Zanskar and the contrasting Moslem culture down in the
valleys of Kishtwar  the unclimbed peaks of considerable interest
around the Shingo La and Umasi La, not too huge and clustered
more dramatically above the Umasi La  not to mention crossing the
streams and keeping the party together! On our approach to the
Umasi La we managed to end up with Harry and I on one side of a
glacier snout and melt waters  quite extensive at seven o'clock
in the evening  and with our porters, tentage, food and sleeping
bags on the other side. Our lot was a forced bivouac at 16,000 ft
at the side of a crumbling glacier snout with thoughts of snow
leopards, until the dawn arrived and we eventually found our way
through the jumbled terrain to our two porters and a welcome
meal.

It was a fine trek. We were a little austere in our planning
with a very basic diet and at the end of three weeks it certainly
felt as though some energy had been expended! The weather was
kind with only one and a half days of poor weather in eighteen
unluckily the one poor day was the day we traversed the Umasi La.
In 1984 Harry and I were joined by other Sheffield based
climbers for another visit to Ladakh. This time eight of us
travelled out to India at different times in July and August to
meet up in Leh some sixty miles north of the Zanskar valley. The
fact that we managed it at all was remarkable, as Kashmir and
Punjab were not in a very settled state at the time and we had
made contingency plans to go further east to the Garwhal if Leh
proved inaccessible. Despite having travelled out in four
separate groups, all eight of us  including Frank and Jennifer
Mellor  met up in Leh during the first week of August for a trek
in the Marka Valley.

I can thoroughly recommend the Marka Valley as an experience
in gentle Himalayan travel, certainly the way we did it and
particularly in contrast to our trip of 1982. Taking advantage of
the tourist office facilities in Leh, we took with us an Indian
Mountaineering Foundation Guide and two horsemen. The Marka
Valley trek is a regular summer tourist route of some seventy to
eighty miles, a round trip from Leh which crosses two passes, the
Ganda La  4,450m  and the Longmaru La  5,220m . From the Ganda La
we had a rather hazy view north west to the Gasherbrum K2 massif
and south to the Kishtwar peaks. We had planned a trekking peak
ascent which turned out to be a sortie into the Kang Yissay
group. We established base camp at about 5,000m in an idyllic
situation and attained the north summit of Kang Yissay  6,090m
and a subsidiary point La Ribla  5,960m  on the opposite side of
the Kang Yissay glacier from the principal peak.

We were eighteen days on this trip including four at base
camp. The highlights of the holiday were many. Leh, being the
capital of Ladakh, has a military garrison and is on the
centuries old Karakoram Pass trade route between Tibet and India
it is more in touch with twentieth century living than Zanskar.
Nevertheless, three of us are fairly convinced that we saw   and
I've got to use the expression   a  "Yeti like creature" leap over
the boulder strewn slopes of Kang Yissay at five o'clock in the
morning soon after we had left base camp on our eleven hour day
on the peak. Our first impression was reinforced later when we
failed to recognise the species on referring to the flora and
fauna of the region on our return to Leh.

The Hemis Gompa, some three hours by bus from Leh, is a fine
example of Buddhist architecture some five hundred years old.
Even better is to walk 1,000 feet above Hemis to the tiny
sanctuary of Goatsang where the Lama regularly scrambles up Grade
IV rock routes to maintain the prayer flags that span the valley.
Hemis is the centre of the Buddhist festival held each year in
May after the winter snows which cut off the valley from October
to April have receded to allow thousands of pilgrims to visit
Ladakh.

This article hardly does justice to our visits to Ladakh in
1982 and 1984. I quote from the pre war writing of Dr. Tom
Longstaff:
"Walk for a week or ten days from Simla along the Hindustan Tibet 'road'
make a camp in the first valley south of the
Satlaj that takes your fancy: from here climb all the peaks on
both sides of the valley and you will have had as much good
climbing as in an Alpine season and for the same expenditure, if
your party consists of not more than three good climbers who can
muster enough Hindustani to do their own job for themselves. Here
is both pleasure and high mountains. The scale is bearable: on
the giants is only labour and weariness: they are best to look
at."    I would not argue with this, but I am sure that I do not
need to remind anyone of the necessity for fitness before
getting to altitude, followed by a sensible period of
acclimatization. After that, the usual medical precautions to
fight the stomach microbes on a short holiday in India are
essential for both "pleasure and high mountains".
As a postscript, do study your logistics. We were a little
short, to say the least, on our porterage when crossing the Umasi
La in 1982. If our two porters had not been prepared to carry
such heavy loads we would not have made it over the pass, and as
a result of their heavy loads, they fell behind on the ascent and
we ended up on opposite sides of the glacier snout that August
night in 1982.

The mountains of Ladakh are many and varied, most of them
awaiting first ascents. Once one moves north over the passes of
Kulu, Chamba and Kashmir one enters a new world   "Little Tibet"
as it has often been called. It is a pocket of high plateau where
India meets China in both the geographical and political terms of
today. The area has never been released from the tensions which
existed in the post war period and it now needs care in its
future development, particularly in relation to tourism. The
signs of rapid progress are already there and I hope that the
mountaineering fraternity will observe the rules.
