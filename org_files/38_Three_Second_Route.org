* A Three Second Route
by
Marian Birkett

A summer evening's gritstone climbing   what more could you
ask for? Hilary and I walked up to the "Unconquerable" area of
Stanage to meet various friends. Pippa and Lisa were just
starting  Right Unconquerable   HVS . I had made the mistake of
climbing  Little Unconquerable  once before, a VS overhanging
gritstone crack, so that was out. What was left? Well, that was
it -  Left Unconquerable , E1 5b   a route I'd been eyeing up for
some time.

The short crack which it shares with  Right Unconquerable
leads to a small ledge, then the crack continues steeply to some
overlaps. The next bit, a sort of awkward lay away, is the crux
after that, big holds up the final steep section lead to the top.

I unpacked my sack. I'd just bought some new rock boots,
B3s, only  25  I can't resist a bargain!  but I hadn't tried them
out yet. Lisa was amazed that I was going to wear them for the
first time on this particular climb. I reasoned that they had to
be better than my Crag Rats and that I needed all the help I
could get. I'd been away and hadn't climbed on gritstone for some
weeks.

I started badly. I took at least ten goes to climb the first
short  supposedly straightforward  crack. The boots were
incredibly uncomfortable: why do they always feel alright when
walking round the shop? I started up the steep crack, putting
lots of runners in   I'd got far too much gear as usual, so I
might as well get rid of it. By the time I'd reached the overlap
my arms were screaming   I spent a while getting Friends in the
horizontal crack and then my ethical stance lowered somewhat.

	"Can you hold me on the rope, Hilary?"

Oh, the relief of being able to let go with my hands! A good
while later, I'd rehearsed in my mind the moves I needed to make
and psyched myself up ready to go.

	"OK Hilary, I'll have another go!"

First get the feet in the longitudinal crack   another small
ledge a bit higher, lay away with the left hand , reach up with
the right   not much of a hold that! Now, keep going   another
couple of moves and I'd reached the big jug with my left hand
marvellous, I'd done it. Or had I? I just needed to get  my left
foot up on that hold and it was still some inches away. My hands
wouldn't work: I was staring at my fingers willing them to stay
there but I saw them slowly uncurling. Whoosh! Suddenly I was
twenty feet lower down, hanging upside down, staring stupidly at
Hilary. She had been sitting down and had been lifted off her
feet as I fell. I felt surprisingly little jolting  it was the
first time I'd fallen when leading unless you count a fall from
about eight feet up a route when my landing was cushioned by my
second's head . I swung the right way up, pulled myself back to
the steep crack, clipped into a runner and hung there to take the
weight off Hilary and to have a rest. So near and yet ...

The others were hoping I'd give up. The midges were biting
and the pubs were open. No chance! I knew I could do it. I'd done
the hard move. I'd just have to do it quicker so I didn't run out
of strength next time.

By this time Pippa had completed  Right Unconquerable  and so
had Lisa. They were getting ready to go. Pippa, thinking that
Hilary would like a rest after belaying me for about an hour,
took over from her. I struggled back up the crack to the overlap.
I was trying to conserve energy as my hope of a clean ascent was
now long gone and I rested often. At the overlap I rested a good
while on a runner, long enough to thoroughly bore Pippa, who now
handed over to Lisa   my third second on this one route.

Realising it was getting dark and that the pubs would soon
be shut, I gathered my energies for a final assault. Where were
those hand holds? There's the jug! Now, fingers, STAY WHERE
YOU'RE PUT this time. Will my foot reach that hold? Yes! Made it!

I collapsed, puffing and panting, above the crux.
Encouraging noises floated up from below. Just the last bit now.
Let's get a runner in   don't want to do that again. Suddenly,
there I was at the top, a slight breeze trying to blow away the
midges. Up came Hilary and Lisa, congratulating me. My first E1
on grit. Maybe I'll do one properly some day.
