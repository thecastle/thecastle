Foreword


The chapters in this book will bring back many personal
memories and make us think of the great days we have spent in the
hills, for most of us have had mountain adventures we shall never
forget. These might be toiling up the final slopes of Mount
Everest, battling against wind and rain on Kinder Scout or
leading a hard route on Lakeland rock.

There are times when it is sheer hell and we wonder why we
are there at all, but on other days it is so fantastically
beautiful we realise there can be no other way of life, for the
joy of mountaineering is a mixture of so many things.

Living close to the hills, as many of us do, is our greatest
privilege and we can sometimes feel sorry for people who do not
have the good fortune to share our glorious environment. However,
the important thing is to use this to the full, cherishing and
enjoying all its natural beauty, but at the same time accepting
the challenge the higher mountains offer, for in return they will
give us unforgettable days of adventure.

It is in the companionship of an organization like The
Castle Mountaineering Club that the mountain life can be enjoyed
to the full. The articles in this book prove that and show what a
wonderful twenty one years it has been for this Club. The next
twenty one should bring even more successful climbing and hill
wandering.
