* Eastern Edges Walk

Frank Mellor

The main body of walkers assembled at The Flouch Inn at half
past eight on a dry but overcast Sunday morning. An advance party
consisting of the youngsters and parents had left earlier to
allow shorter legs a little more time to negotiate the initial
boggy sections.

The main party was soon heading up Cut Gate, though Jack had
to be restrained from ploughing over the eroded portion of the
path which was fenced off for restoration purposes. Once the
little notice had been read to him and the possibility of wardens
lurking in the conifers had been pointed out, he agreed to the
recommended variation, though not without mutterings about his
preference for going straight up.

The path was followed without further incident until Margery
Hill was attained. Jack now made amends for his previous
indiscretion by imparting a most valuable piece of information
namely that we were now standing on the highest ground in
Sheffield. Fortified by this gem and spiritually uplifted by the
generous manner in which it was given, we felt able to continue
to Featherbed Moss. In a state of euphoria, we wandered
southwards until Abbey Brook lay below us. It was unfortunate
that, as we dithered on the brink, we were witnessed by the
advance party who had taken the more conventional contouring path
around the head of the clough. Now was an opportunity for
individual variation and a dozen people took nearly the same
number of different routes for Back Tor. Everyone arrived within
minutes of each other and a welcome break was taken by all
nineteen walkers, together now for the first time. It was
generally agreed that the most tiring part of the walk was over
and, barring nuclear attack, success was assured. In fact all
that remained was to sit back and we would soon be at The Robin
Hood near Baslow.

As time went by it became evident that a little stroll was
still necessary in order to achieve our objective and so we set
off down Derwent Edge. The view became increasingly more
interesting as we passed Wheel Stones and continued across
Highshaw Clough down to Moscar House.

A short walk up the road, then we were striding away  from
the exhaust fumes toward Stanage. We took another break  near
High Neb since this was reckoned to be the half way point. Whilst
lunching we greeted a passing couple. The young lady returned our
 salutations, but her companion was heard to say "It's The
Castle!" whereupon she was shepherded away along the Edge with
only an occasional backward glance. Shortly after this we met
Dave and Jenny, who had walked up from The Robin Hood where they
had kindly deposited a car for our return.

From Stanage we chose to walk down the Green Drive below
Burbage, rather than over Higger Tor, and thence into Longshaw
where we took a welcome tea break at the cafe. This proved very
refreshing and gave us a lift for the last leg. We were soon over
Froggatt in the gathering gloom, but there was a little stumbling
and grumbling as it got darker on Curbar Edge. Most people had
torches at the ready for the traverse of Baslow Edge and we found
the Wellington Monument without much trouble. Jack attempted to
rid himself of some Grappa at this stage but with little success
  judging by the response of those who were tempted, he will be
offering his bottle round for several years to come!

It was drizzling now so we went at a fair pace down the
track to the crossroads and then made a rather rough crossing up
to Birchen Edge. The path there was a welcome sight and it was
followed easily down to The Robin Hood   which was shut! We had
taken ten hours for the walk, arriving a good half hour before
opening time. A vote of thanks was offered to Jack as we waited,
shivering in the freezing cold evening with only one hip flask of
Grouse between nineteen.
