* Benighted on the Ben
by
Ian Barton

It was early January when six of us travelled up to
Scotland. Arriving in Glencoe in the small hours, we crept into the
bunkhouse at The Kingshouse and collapsed on the floor intending to
make an early start. Naturally we overslept, but still managed to
leave without paying, creeping past Big Ian who was watching breakfast
TV in his house.

There was the usual chaotic sort out of gear at the golf
course before beginning the slog up to the CIC hut. Inevitably I put
my boot through the frozen crust of peat at the start of the path
which, resulting in a cold wet foot. It had been a cold, clear night
with a fine dawn but a storm was forecast later in the day.  I walked
quickly up the coire and on reaching the hut, I collapsed outside and
waited for Andy to catch up. Fortunately he was even more unfit than
me and I was well rested by the time arrived. As soon as Andy reached
the hut it started to cloud over and flakes of snow began to
fall. After some discussion we decided to go for Glover's Chimney
. Neither of us had done it before and it was a relatively short
route, albeit with the crux at the top which we hoped to climb before
the weather really closed in. We geared up next to the hut on the
pretence that gear you are wearing always weighs less than gear
carried in your ruck sack.

It had been freezing hard for a couple of weeks but there had
been no thaw consequently, the way up into Coire na Ciste was a wallow
in deep powder. This was Andy's first winter route since our trip last
year another epic in Crowberry's Left Fork and he was feeling the
strain. Despite numerous pleas to be allowed to go down on the pretext
that he was totally knackered, I finally cajoled and persuaded him to
the bottom of the route where he promptly collapsed into a mini
bergschrund.

I uncoiled the ropes and stuffed Mars bars into his mouth in
an attempt to revive him. My observation that, although we had not yet
started climbing, we now were almost at the summit and so could not
possibly go back to the hut, was not too well received!

Leaving Andy to sort out the ropes I wallowed over the
bergschrund and managed to get myself established on the first
pitch. The ice was very brittle and I despatched a few dinner plates
down the hill to keep Andy awake. Confident that this first ice fall
was only about a hundred feet long I was puzzled when I ran out of
rope about thirty feet from the top and was forced to belay on a
couple of poor ice screws. By this time Andy had recovered a little
and made short work of seconding this pitch.

The next few hundred feet looked straightforward but devoid of
belays, so I asked Andy to start climbing as soon as the rope went
tight. The weather had closed in and there was a constant stream of
spindrift pouring down on us as we climbed. At the top of the easy
section I went too far left and had to teeter back across a rib of
rock to regain the gully.

Eventually I arrived below the final chimney and began to look
for a belay. After spending some time searching for a peggable crack
without success, I noticed a peg sprouting from the gully wall right
next to me and hurriedly tied on. I had just managed to arrange the
Sticht Plate when Andy arrived.  "That was a very long pitch," he
said.  "Yes," I replied, "about three hundred feet I had to stretch
the ropes a bit! We've only got to get up this little chimney and then
we are at Tower Gap."

The crux chimney proved deceptively awkward, not helped by a
lack of ice where it mattered most. I spoilt the illusion that I was
confident and in control by performing an energetic mantleshelf to get
onto Tower Gap and then falling down the far side. Luckily the rope
drag stopped me after only a few feet.

Andy used his secret weapon, the Alpenstock, to overcome the
crux. Not possessing any axes of his own, the only ones he had been
able to borrow were a couple of very long walking axes.  These
actually proved ideal for the route enabling him to reach right past
the crux and plant them firmly in the good ice at Tower Gap.

"Can't see what all the fuss was about. Why didn't you just
reach up to the good ice on the top?"  It was by now almost dark and
speed was essential. I set off up the rest of Tower Ridge in a hurry,
impressing on Andy the awful consequences of a slip into the unseen
void from the ridge.  However, there were no further technical
difficulties and we reached the top of Tower Ridge just as it got
completely dark.  "It's OK," I said. "I've got all the compass
bearings written down in the front of the guidebook. If we go to the
summit we can go down the tourist track from there."

Setting off on the correct bearing, we counted the paces but
failed to find the summit. Retracing our steps on a back bearing, we
then failed to find the top of Tower Ridge again and so were totally
lost.

"Oh well, never mind, if we just keep going heading west we
should get down to the col eventually."  We felt our way along the
summit plateau but eventually ran into steep ground. Mindful of an
accident to a couple of friends the previous week in similar
conditions, we decided to bivvy.  "Let's just dig a ledge by this
boulder and sit it out till morning."  "What do you mean, you've
forgotten your bivvy bag? Oh well, if I empty my sack into yours you
can use that, it's got a bivvy extension."

Some time later, after everything was sorted out, we settled
down and ate the last remaining chocolate.  "Your rucksack doesn't
meet the bottom of my cag and the spindrift is blowing up my shirt,"
complained Andy.  "It's incredibly boring sitting here."  "I've just
found my hip flask and it's half full of Grouse."  A drunken couple of
hours passed by as the contents of the hip flask were consumed.  "What
time is it?" I asked.  "About seven o'clock."  "Oh good, it will be
light in a few minutes."  "No, it's seven in the evening!"

At this point I threw a wobbler and declared that I was not
going to sit there for another twelve hours freezing to death.  Andy
was also extremely cold and readily agreed to another attempt at
descending. We repacked all the gear and after a short conference,
huddled round the map, decided to set off on a bearing of due south.

Staggering along by the light of the head torch, we remained
roped up in the best tradition, ensuring that we would both die should
one of us slip. After what seemed like hours stumbling downhill we
finally dropped below the cloud to see that we had emerged at one end
of Glen Nevis the wrong end!

Some time later we reached the road and we were not looking
forward to the five mile trudge back to Fort William. However, luck
was with us and two farmers in a Land Rover offered us a lift. They
claimed to have been driving along the glen shining a searchlight up
and down it to try and spot a fox which had been molesting sheep. They
were armed with a rifle to dispatch the animal but it had proved too
cunning and remained hidden. They left us at the Nevis Bank Hotel
where we had arranged to meet the others. Inevitably there was no sign
of them but after we had drunk a couple of pints the barmaid came
over.

"Are you two supposed to be meeting someone here?"  We replied
that we were indeed.  "Oh good, they've left this note for
you."  Unfolding the note we read the following: "If you
aren't dead please can you go to the Police Station and tell
them. We have gone to the Red Squirrel in Glencoe."

Trudging round to the Police Station we informed the policeman
on duty that we were still alive despite appearances to the contrary
and asked for directions to the chip shop.  Failure to get a lift to
Glencoe at midnight forced us to pay for a taxi and we arrived at the
Red Squirrel somewhat dispirited and tired.

The others were pleased to see us and we were made to relate
our story.

"Did you tell them at the Police Station that you were back
safely?"

I replied in the affirmative.

"When we went to report you missing they were really good to
us and made us all cups of tea!"

There's no justice.
