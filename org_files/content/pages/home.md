In 1988 The Castle Mountaineering Club of Sheffield published a book,
containing articles written by Club members, to celebrate the Club's 21st
anniversary. The Club is still thriving and 2017 will be its 50th
anniversary. As part of the celebrations we wanted to reproduce the
21st anniversary book in various electronic formats. The book will be
available in pdf, ePub, html and mobi (Kindle) formats. You are
currently viewing the html version!

In republishing the book we have tried to stick a closely as possible
to the book's original format, with photos and cartoons in the same
positions as they were in the book. The publication is still a work in
progress. The book is being made available under a Creative Commons
licence and the source for all the different formats is available on
[Github](https://github.com/thecastle/thecastle) . This web site contains all the original articles, cartoons and
photos. The articles were originally written in WordPerfect, so while
all the original content is here it hasn't all been proof read, so
there are probably still lots of formatting errors.
