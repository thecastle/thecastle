* The Siege of Clachaig Gully
#+latex: \chapterauthor{Alan Fowler}

On one of the earliest Glencoe meets the sun actually shone
on both the Saturday and the Sunday! Faced with the long drive
home that night, a group of us looked for a climb which didn't
involve a long approach and decided on    Clachaig Gully   . We packed
up and were about to start out from Lagangarbh when someone asked
what we had in mind.

"Clachaig Gully? That sounds like a good idea. Mind if I
come along?"

By the time we had set off from the pub car park the numbers
had swollen to about twelve and it had the makings of a good
epic. I can't remember all the names but Mike Anderson, Ashley
Turner and Dick Arnold were definitely among the team.

The early pitches went well and we made rapid progress
despite the numbers. Then we came to the cave pitch  Mike led
this and I followed. No one else felt like leading it so, sitting
on the little saddle at the top of the pitch, I began top roping
people and lowering them down the other side of the ledge where
they could unrope and walk into the bed of the gully. It was
pleasant enough sitting up there in the sunshine and when the
last man was up I swung down to the ledge, coiled the rope and
walked up the gully fully expecting to find a top rope on the
next pitch. What greeted me was a very glum circle of people.

"Your pitch" said Mike, before I could object. This was the
famous Jericho Wall, dripping in water and slightly overhanging.
My first attempts all ended in failure, which was in itself only
slightly frustrating compared to the added annoyance caused by
the water streaming down my shirt sleeves. The problem was
getting a foot onto a small incut hold about eight feet up  the
slime covered wall offered no positive foothold and what hand
holds there may have been were similarly slippery.

Reversing the route was totally out of the question so, rummaging in
my sack, I dragged out my secret weapon. A peg!  This, placed at head
height, gave me enough assistance to gain the foothold the holds above
were then within reach and the rest of the wall was easier. I threw
the rope into the gully and the rest of the team began their
ascent. About half the team were up when I heard the clatter of
equipment as another group reached the top of the cave pitch. Then the
distinctive twang of a Glasgow accent drifted up.  If they found us
using a peg on their route there would be a lynching!

"Get that peg out quick, the Scots are coming," I shouted
down. Two taps of the hammer and the evidence of our
transgression was removed.

The Scots were left to climb the pitch by their own devices,
giving us enough time to implement our escape in the best Castle
traditions of tact, diplomacy... and self preservation.
