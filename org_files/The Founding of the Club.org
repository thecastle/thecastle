The Founding of the Club

by

Langdale, 29th September 1967: torrential rain, the  road
flooded in several places, the campsite very much the same.
Hardly an auspicious first meet for a new Club, but one that is
nevertheless still flourishing twenty one years later. All
members of the Club have since experienced similar discomforts,
with the additional attractions of cold, hail, sleet and snow.
Now at last we can reveal where the responsibility lies.

Alec Barclay came from across the Border to seek
satisfaction for causes long gone: at least that is what we put
it down to when we were induced to go to Scotland and elsewhere
to be tortured by long walks and hard climbs. Alec and his
colleague Colin Mackie had first taken a small party of
Sheffielders for a weekend in Glencoe in March 1967, followed by
a further visit in July the same year. It was after these trips
that the idea of forming a club came to Alec. Discussions back in
Sheffield met with enthusiasm and convinced Alec that he had the
nucleus for the formation of a viable club.

A nine strong meeting of stalwarts held at Ashley and Avril
Turner's house on Monday 25th September 1967 led directly to the
founding of the Club. As all of them were "regulars" at The
Castle Inn at Bradway it was natural and appropriate  as they
intended to meet there on their weekly club night  that the Inn
should lend its name to the Club. But what to call it? The Castle
Climbing Club, or The Castle Mountaineering Club? After a long
discussion it was decided to name it "The Castle Mountaineering
Club", in the belief that this title  indicating the basic
principle of putting one foot in front of the other to gain
height  would provide the widest possible base for the Club and
give encouragement to prospective new members.

A proposal by Alec that the Club should exist to further the
spirit of mountaineering on the one hand and to offer instruction
in specific techniques on the other, was duly accepted. It was
agreed that The Castle Inn should be the Club's headquarters
until suitable premises could be found. Alec himself would act as
first Hon. Secretary and Colin Mackie as first President, a ,
committee was duly elected and a constitution adopted on 9th
October 1967.

The success of The Castle Mountaineering Club owes a great
deal to the decision taken in those early days to establish the
Club as a "Mountaineering Club". Members have been encouraged
over the years to extend their mountaineering skills over a wide
range of activities, be they climbing, hill walking, skiing or
pot holing  even pot holing: a little difficult to put one foot
in front of the other underground and still gain height!
Whatever the activity, the Club has always afforded opportunities
for its members to acquire experience in all aspects of climbing
and mountaineering.

Regular meets were held from the outset with climbing
sessions every week on local Edges and an away meet each month to
different parts of England, Wales and Scotland. The Club rapidly
became something of a family with meetings in members' houses and
with slide shows and lectures in addition to the regular club
nights at The Castle Inn.

THE FIRST STEPS HAD BEEN SUCCESSFULLY TAKEN.

But with growing membership, the need to find a clubroom
which would fulfil one of The Castle's ambitions soon became
apparent. That saga, an epic in its own right, was about to
begin.
