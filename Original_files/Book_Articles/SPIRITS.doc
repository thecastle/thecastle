   Some years ago, while visiting the battle site of Culloden Field, on a damp and misty September day, I was subjected to a feeling of utter dread.  Subconscious emotions told me, "I must get away"!
  
  People could wander round the graves from clan to clan for hours but the whole visit lasted less than 20 minutes.  A year later in the middle of the vast winter landscape of the Cairngorms, I suffered the same experience.

 It was a typical Castle plod, made worse by dense cloud and deteriorating conditions, but our spirits were high even though Chris Holmes, Dick Savage and myself felt more at home on rock than playing the mountain man.  We were walking through our first and only "white out", and enjoying its weird effect when suddenly a snow bank resolved into focus in front of my eyes.  It was not the snow bank that I saw but a hole in the snow,  approximately one metre square.
    We entered, and as the tunnel opened out, were stunned with surprise by the ice village which greeted our eyes. It was without doubt the Ritz of all snow holes as room after room connected each other, complete with their own table, chairs, raised bed and shelving systems all made out of ice.  It must have been a distant relic from a winter survival course at Glenmore Lodge but the unnatural silence together with the ambient light that soaked through the ice walls, transformed the shelter into a mortuary of past memories. Thinking of ghosts, goblins and yetis, we ran out of the tunnel and back to the welcoming "white". 

A few more miles and our high spirits changed.  Even though we had just reached our goal against all the odds, the summit of Ben Macdhui gave us no pleasure.  I can remember approaching the final slopes trying to find an excuse to turn back, but there was no rational explanation why, and so we went on. 

The cairn was found quite by accident (we were standing on it!) because the snow level covered all but the brass plaque on top which shows the various peaks and directions.  There was no vista to enjoy but grey dread and an urge to go home quickly.
The usual summit rest, comprising of a bite to eat while soaking in your self-satisfaction was limited to a quick photo before we legged it back down the mountain.

The campsite talk that night re-lived the arduous knee deep slush and the "white out", but not Ben Macdhui.  Our personal thoughts were united but never shared.  After all, it was only in the mind!

Recently I was reading a book entitled Scottish ghost stories and to my surprise, discovered that there is an alleged ghoul on Ben Macdhui. Although never seen it has been responsible for many campers fleeing for their lives - leaving tents and equipment behind, totally convinced of their impending doom if they remained there any longer.  Gruesome stuff!
