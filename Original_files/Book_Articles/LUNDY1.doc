                    *  THE LUNDY EXPERIENCE  *
                    **************************

     Sailing across the bobbing sea towards Lundy, we thought we were so clever!
   For the price of a day return we had just enough time to crack off the classic rock route called Devils Slide. The ship's time table indicated a visit of three hours on the Island before returning, which was just enough time to walk over to the other side of the Island, climb the route and then walk back. It was as simple as that.
That was until the loud speaker announcement said ....
 " INFORMATION TO THE PASSENGERS - THE SHIP WILL REACH LUNDY AT FOURTEEN HUNDRED HOURS AND DISEMBARKATION WILL TAKE APROXIMATELY FORTY FIVE MINUTES. WILL PASSENGERS BE AT THE EMBARKATION POINT NO LATER THAN SIXTEEN HUNDRED HOURS. THANK YOU ".
"Hang on, I thought we had three hours!" We did, from the ships arrival to its departure but unfortunately  that did not take into account leaving and boarding the Ship. "Oh No!!"
Ian laureston was beginning to look upset at the thought of wasting all that money on the crossing. We could tell by the way his bottom lip started to curl.
"Wait a minute, we could still do it if we ran, but we would have to make sure that we were the first off the ship."   We all reluctantly agreed to give it a go, all except Serina who was totally repulsed by the idea of running!

That left four of us, myself and Ian plus Debbie Hall and Rodger C. (who was nicknamed, Codger) all waiting in the queue, trying to get off that damn ship.

Dry land came 30 minutes later leaving 1.1/4 hours left.  We ran.

Navigation was easy due to the fact there was only one path - from one side of the Island to the other - and by the time we located the top of the rock route, it was time to head back
 (30 minutes left). 

Ian and Codger lost thier bottle and, hearts pounding, started to run back to the ship.  I was determined not to waste my investment so, without hesitation, started scrambling down the descent gully to the base of the slab.  Debbie shouted "Could I have a go!" Time was pressing. A roped ascent ? Not on your nellie!

As I ran up the slab I met Debbie near the top, dumbstruck from witnessing 700 ft of climbing in one and a half minutes.  The feat was not due to climbing skill, but more to the superb friction of the granite.  She threw me the rope! "I'm determined to climb the last pitch at least" she screamed.  Debbie was very keen - what could I do but take the rope for her to follow. 

The last pitch of Devils Slide is the crux and best pitch of the route and she enjoyed it, but not the sound of the ships horn far away in the distance.
(15 minutes left!) "For gods sake Debbie - go, I'll catch up with you when I've coiled this rope."
"Please, I used the rope, let me coil it."
"Dont be gallant, and sod off!"  Reluctantly She scrambled over the cliff top in her usual carefree manner and quickly dissappeared from sight. Three minutes later I also emerged onto the skyline . 
   What followed was the run of my life. (S.A.C.C. race under 30 minutes!)  It must have been, because I caught up Ian and Codger panting down the path.  Another blast from the ships horn turned Ian's face to ashen.  "Where's Debbie?" I said - they said! "She must be here, because there is only one path and I never passed her".  We stood there, frozen to the spot. There was another blast from the ship. 

After a brief discussion we realised that she'd gone to the opposite side of the island. "Shall we wait or..." another blast from the ship sent us running towards the beach to be greeted by Serina, close to tears, with the last boat waiting to sail across the short distance to the ship.
" But you can't go and leave our friend behind on the Island," pleaded Ian to the seaman.
  "We must leave NOW!" boomed the man sympathetically but stern. It was at this point that Ian gallantly volunteered to stay behind and search the bleak moors for poor Debbie, but again he was rebuffed " No one is allowed on the Island without permission. Please get on the boat!"
    With that, we left our Deb to a fate worse than death, all alone to doss behind a stone wall or tuft of grass. We sat there on the deck, still geared up, rucksacks and ropes all over and surrounded by tourists with slightly bemused expressions. Then came the announcement on the loud speaker....
" WILL THE CLIMBING PARTY WHO HAS LEFT A GIRL CLIMBER BEHIND ON THE ISLAND  (to rot) PLEASE COME TO THE BRIDGE AT ONCE!" 
All eyes turned our way, I could have died!  The ultimate indignation.
    That evening we never went to the pub. Feeling quite ashamed of ourselves, we went to bed wondering if she knew which twinkle in the sky was the Pole Star,( If she found difficulty in knowing left from right, there was little chance.)  Poor Deb. 

The morning came and following the captains instructions we phoned a number on the island to see if Deb was found.  She was there, on the line!

"Hullo Debbie, are you alright" piped Ian "Yes thanks" replied Deb, " I found this lighthouse and they were having a party inside - they invited me in and gave me free drinks and food, accommodation for the night and a hugh breakfast. I've had a whale of a time!"

We waited at the dockside that afternoon. Ian brandished a club, Codger a crowbar and me, a revolver! 
                                    
   "Come here Debbie."
