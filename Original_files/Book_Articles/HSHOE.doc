ÁÁThere have recently been problems with climbing at HorseshoeQuarry and several people have been asked to leave.

It seems that the quarry is still listed as active and the owners(Tarmac) have a legal obligation to deny access. If they do notdo so they can be prosecuted.

If you want to climb there ”please do not take cars into thequarry or leave them at the gate.• There is a good layby a shortdistance up the road. Take care not to damage the fence and bediscreet, if asked to leave do so. Please note that this accessproblem is not Tarmac's fault so if you are approached by one oftheir employees please be cooperative or we may lose the quarryfor climbing altogether.
