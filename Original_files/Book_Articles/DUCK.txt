The Search for the Drunken Duck or "Doesn't Anybody Want to Buy
any Petrol?

	It was a fairly typical weekend in Langdale. It had rained
on and off (more on than off) all the Saturday. Some of us had
convincingly demonstrated that one could get just as wet in half
a day as in a full day by walking up Side Pike in a monsoon.

	After a meal back at the campsite the talk naturally centred
on which pub we should honour with our presence that evening.
"How about the Drunken Duck?", I suggested. "The what?". "Where's
that?". "It's a pub somewhere between here and Coniston. It's
supposed to have some good sing©songs."

Armed with this scant knowledge a convoy of four vehicles set
forth. A look at the map will show quite a network of minor roads
in this area and with the rain persisting (sic) it down there was
no one to ask the way. Suddenly there were the lights from a
garage ahead so we drove onto the forecourt. A man ran from the
office with a mac over his head thinking he had some customers.
"Excuse me. Could you tell me where the Drunken Duck is please?"
A look of disappointment crossed his face. "Yes next left then
right about half a mile further on." "Thanks mate". We drove off
into the dark and rain leaving the dampened attendant to walk
back to his warm office.

	Five minutes later another car pulled up at the garage. The
attendant put his mac back on his head and ran out. "Excuse me.
Could you tell me where the Drunken Duck is please?"  "Yes next
left then right about half a mile further on." "Thanks mate". And
the car drove off.

	Five minutes later another car arrived an even damper
attendant emerged, the same question was asked and the same reply
given.

	A further five minutes and another car arrived.

	As this last car drove off the soaking attendant was heard
to utter an agonising to cry, "Doesn't Anyone Want to Buy Any Petrol!"
